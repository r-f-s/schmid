                        <section class="partOne">
                            <p>Of my grandparents’ seven grandchildren, I am the only one still alive who consciously experienced the tragedy that precipitated the Schmid family’s emigration to America. So I have set out to rescue precious knowledge and to acquaint you with my view of the character and circumstances of our forebears.  What I have learned and what I remember I will try to pass on to you as free from bias as I can manage. I am aware that when I travel back in my mind to a past in which I was a loved and happy child, I am in a world that never was. The great German historian Leopold von Ranke said that a historian’s responsibility is to tell it <em>wie es eigentlich gewesen</em> (as it actually was). That is a big challenge, as many of the modest lives here depicted are known only in the roughest outline, fragments without nuance. I will attempt it nonetheless, but it is hard to do it even for one family. Our records are very limited. Before my father’s generation we have information only about the Brunhübners, my father’s maternal ancestors. Even in that case the only manuscript materials pre-dating 1900 are Wilhelm Brunhübner’s (1842–1900) diary from 1860, and a letter he wrote to Willi, his first grandson, when he was born in 1893.  The collection of letters from Willi to Kate, and her to him, are a treasure, though many more of Willi’s letters survive than Kate’s.</p>
       	                
                            <p>It must be remembered that Kate had about sixty years during which she could weed her correspondence to suit herself. I know that she burnt or otherwise got rid of hundreds of letters, but I do not know whose letters. Of her mother Hedwig’s letters and cards to her, fewer than ten survive. There are no letters from her other relatives with the exception of two from her uncle, Max Pinner, and one condolence letter from her brother Fredi. During Nazi times everyone, particularly someone whose life had already been irremediably altered by the Gestapo, had reason to censor his or her correspondence. That Kate did so is clear: there is only one reference to the Nazis, which is that Kate’s mother writes that she intends to listen to a Führer speech on the radio. In all the letters dating from the time after Willi’s murder on June 30, 1934 there is barely a hint of what country we are in, let alone any comment on political events of any kind. Only Kate’s letters from Salzburg contained scattered references to some events like November 9 being made a holiday in 1935 (on November 9, 1935 the Nürnberg laws against the Jews were passed), or to certain people, like Fritz Wiedemann, Hitler’s adjudant, who helped her. Even these references are carefully couched in neutral language. I can vouch for Kate’s fear of censorship because I sometimes accompanied her when she drove from Salzburg to Freilassing across the German border to mail her letters, mostly to Hoerlin, from a German mailbox.  The happy circumstance that Kate fell deeply in love with Herman Hoerlin within a few months of Willi’s death was not only a deliverance and a blessing for her, but also for the three Schmid children.</p>
                        
                            <p>Another relatively extensive source of useful material is the many letters sent to Kate after news of the murder reached family, friends and acquaintances. They were followed a year later by letters responding to the publication of the <em>Unvollendete Symphonie</em> (Unfinished Symphony), the title Kate gave to the collection of Willi’s literary remains. </p>     
                        
                            <p>I have read numerous histories and memoirs to increase my understanding of the place and times in which my parents grew up. Much remains to be done: genealogical inquiries and research into pre-World War I Mecklenburg and into Hedwig Tietz’s origins in Glogau, now Glogow, Poland. I have a certain predilection for Bavaria, since that is where Willi, Kate and we three children lived, but the fact that the bulk of the chronicle is based in Bavaria has another, less subjective reason. For Kate, the Schmids and her life in Munich represented a coming into her own. She really had been somewhat of a misfit in the Tietz family.<span class="citation">1</span> It seems to me, although I could of course be mistaken, that there must have been some trace of shame or embarrassment in Hedwig Tietz’s unconscious attitude toward her adored illegitimate daughter, and some trace of resentment on Adolf Tietz’s part toward this non-daughter of his. In the provincial town of Schwerin this Jewish family were certainly outsiders, as their almost entirely Jewish circle of acquaintances shows. They were also extremely bourgeois and conservative. It stands to reason that they, as shopkeepers, depended on the community’s good will, and therefore generally conformed to conservative opinion and mores.  Their flamboyant, beautiful and self-willed little girl must have been far more eye-catching than they might have wanted. Her temperament and outstanding intelligence did not fit the plans they had for her. Adolf Tietz insisted on commercial training for her so she could find a job in business as soon as possible. She was indeed a skilled typist—but would it not have been more suitable to let her finish off her gymnasium studies with the Abitur, the famous German secondary school exam?  The circumstance of the Tietz’s fortune being at a low ebb at the end of World War I, and the years following that brought catastrophic conditions in Germany, no doubt had a grievous effect on Adolf and Hedwig’s outlook and perhaps even their health.</p>
                        
                            <p>When Kate came into Willi’s family she found people who were, in some sense, no more part of the establishment than her Jewish family of origin.  Josef Schmid had lost his father when he was four and been placed in an orphanage by his mother. Later, as a teacher, he should have belonged to the petty bourgeoisie. But his free spirit, easy ways and many interests made him, despite everything, somewhat independent of his circumstances. His wife, Margarethe Brunhübner Schmid, while the least intellectual of the Brunhübner siblings, had a strong sense of entitlement. Her brother Hans was a doctor and a lover of classical Greece. Her sister Babette was a devotee of Goethe and of Rome, and Reta, as Margarethe was called, behaved with a somewhat touchy gentility that reflected her status as she felt it.  She had landed a handsome husband, popular with one and all, with whom she produced her three beloved children. There was Willi, the brightest and most musical, Elli of the beautiful voice, with a golden heart, and Walter, the adored youngest, as handsome as his father, extremely musical and full of an inspired sense of humor. </p>
                        
                            <p>The house was always full of music and the parents’ ambitions for their children were high-flown but not everyone’s choice. These ambitions would place their children in socially useful or intellectually worthy circles, and only secondarily provide them with financial security. This family who barely ever had savings in the bank looked down on money and on those for whom money was important. </p>

                            <p>An illustration of this financial indifference was Walter Schmid’s courtship of Tante Toni. Antonie Heller was the daughter of an old established Munich merchant, who could afford to send his daughter to the <em>Hochschule für Musik</em> in Munich. The Hellers were scandalized to discover Toni and Walter’s love for each other. Walter, the son of a teacher, a <em>Hungerleider</em> (a needy wretch, a starveling), dared to court their gifted, handsome daughter?  They forbade her to see Walter, with the result that the young people met in Munich’s extensive parks every day.  After this had gone on for a while, Pipsi, as Josef was called by his children, who was well aware of their meetings, decided to put an end to secrecy and intimidation, judging rightly that this was true love that would never yield. So he went to call on Herr Heller and got right to the point. He asked whether Herr Heller thought that Walter had some sort of ulterior motive in courting Toni? He assured Herr Heller that his son was motivated solely by true love, that none of the Schmids had any interest whatsoever in the Heller money—it meant nothing to them. What they were interested in was Walter’s happiness. It had become quite clear that the young people could not happily live without each other. He, Josef Schmid, urged Herr Heller to put his daughter’s happiness first and withdraw his prohibition. Herr Heller was persuaded; Toni and Walter got engaged immediately and married in December of 1923. They loved each other unwaveringly their whole lives, until Walter was killed in World War II at the age of 46. Toni once asked her son Willi if he had felt loved enough by her and Walter. She later wrote: “We loved each other so much that in a way you children always came second.” </p>

                            <p>Money was a necessary evil for the Schmids: knowledge, and joy, music, a happy family and a virtuous life were what mattered. When Willi and Kate’s third child, Hedi, arrived in the ruinous aftermath of the Depression, in May of 1932, Pipsi congratulated the happy parents with his whole heart and sent them a little verse that said, “Where the Lord sends a bunny, he’ll also send a blade of grass to feed it.” Willi and Kate were delighted with Hedi’s birth, especially because she turned out to be a highly original, enterprising soul, as was evident right from the beginning.  Her quickness and keenness kept us all at full attention. I must say that I never knew another child who was as chipper and full of exuberance as Hedi, and that includes my own greatly loved children. Kate may not have had quite the same trust in God as her family-in-law, but she felt loved and sheltered by them. They truly became her family. She was at home with the Schmids.</p>
                        
                            <p>Will you read the little saying about the bunny and feel superior to your great-grandfather, because you know one must strive, one must be responsible, one must rely on oneself? How can I make his trust in God real to you? How can I tell it “as it actually was”? You must picture the Schmids’ childhood in a world where electric light was still a novelty; where until the 1930s the only family member who had a telephone was my great-uncle Hans, a physician; where hot water for baths was heated on a wood- or coal-burning stove; where there were almost no automobiles and therefore few paved roads; no airplanes, no radio or television. In Bavaria there was a king, in Mecklenburg a Grand Duke, rulers whose absolute power was only a little curtailed by a feeble constitution and the fact that they had to answer to the German emperor in Berlin. Bavaria and Mecklenburg were both largely rural. By far the greatest number of residents in both lands were employed in or connected to agriculture. There was a certain conviction that to be a farmer was the most virtuous way to live. Industry was largely limited to Bavaria’s “big” cities (Augsburg, Nürnberg and Munich) and to Mecklenburg’s ports, Wismar, Warnemünde, Rostock. Along with the almost feudal nature of Mecklenburg and the great number of small farmers in Bavaria, there was deep respect in both lands for arts and letters. Munich at the turn of the century was, in fact, esteemed for its music, art and literature, nearly as much as Vienna, Paris and Rome. <em>“München leuchtete,”</em> (“Munich glowed”) wrote Thomas Mann, choosing the word that conveys the glowing of a lamp.</p>
                            
                            <p>The countryside that sheltered Kate and Willi when they were children differed in physical features, mountains versus plain, but there were lakes everywhere in both places, woods full of wild flowers, a deep Sunday quiet as people went to church, and absolutely nothing was open for business. Try to picture such a peaceful time in your minds—but, in order not to make it too much of a fairytale include the dusty roads and streets, the horse dung everywhere and the resultant flies, include the street car wheels shrieking on their tracks, trains spewing black coal dust on both sides. (Cinders in the eye from steam engine chimneys were an unwelcome accompaniment to travel even in my childhood.)</p>
                            
                            <p>“We all grew up knowing our future. We could count on becoming what we wanted to be,” Kate told me once. But all that changed rapidly and forever with World War I. Those who served on the battlefield, like Willi, saw and suffered unspeakable horrors. Empires, monarchies, and even Grand Duchies disappeared. Chaotic conditions were followed by a number of extreme political experiments; roving bands of armed ex-soldiers defied any governmental control in Germany. The infamous Versailles Treaty imposed impossible-to-fulfill economic demands on Germany, while hunger, cold, anger and confusion took their toll. </p>
                            
                            <p>“I have never loved Germany more than now in her misery,” Willi wrote to Kate on December 4, 1918. Since we know the outcome of events hidden to Willi and Kate our horror as we follow developments outweighs our pity. But pity was the right emotion at the time.  Millions of duped, clueless people trying to get some sort of life back, and how could you get a life under the existing <span id="loadTwo">circumstances?</span></p>
                            
                            <p>Those who had passively counted on a secure future, with parameters more or less determined by a powerful state, who had been worn down by the demands of a long and eventually hopeless war, who were despised by most of Europe, were not well prepared for the vigorous civic action needed to remake their nation. Their education had trained them to respect authority and to behave themselves. Enterprising, lively and most of all responsible participation in government was a closed book to most. Loyal opposition appears to have been not only a foreign but an entirely unknown quality. Every last splinter party fought every other one in the foolhardy confidence that there was only one right answer to all the problems facing Germany, and that answer lay in its own platform.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the midst of this upheaval, which historians recognize as one of the great watersheds of modern times, Willi and Kate met, fell passionately in love and began a family.  They were idealistic, innocent, brave, intelligent, and completely indefatigable, and, looked at with the cold eye of realism, probably foolhardy. They persisted in their vision of a worthwhile and loving life no matter what the odds until Willi was killed and it was all over.</p>
                        
                            <p>When I look at our family today, I realize with awe and gratitude that in actuality, in some sense, it was not all over. Credit for this outcome goes primarily to Kate, whose determination and tenacious optimism, along with her charm as a woman and her deep love for her children, carried us from Munich to Salzburg to Binghamton, New York. Credit goes to a major extent also to Herman Hoerlin. He took on Kate’s children when he was thirty-five years old, and to the end of his life at eighty cared for them, supported and loved them as much as he could, with a commitment that was laudable and most exceptional, and for which we must be profoundly grateful. In addition to these two admirable people, with whatever flaws they had, one senses a residue of Willi, an afterglow of his influence. Part of it came through the legacy of Catholicism, a major factor in Hedi and Thomi’s lives, and a major influence even in mine. Part of it came from the trust in God and the joy in the world that had accompanied the Schmid children from birth, a blessing that would outlast Willi. These were his gift to us from beyond the grave.  We have been sheltered by that grace; it has seen us through the most difficult challenges of our lives.  Thomi was the hardest hit by adversities we can only conjecture, yet he came to the end of his life a whole person who was able to say, “If I were God, I would forgive me. What makes me think that He won’t?”</p>
                            
                            <p>I have contemplated, many times, Willi’s last moments in Dachau, when he knew that he would have to leave his family in God’s hands. I believe that he was not in despair, but that he commended his spirit and ours to his dear Lord. Despite whatever pain has fallen to the lot of us descendants, we have nevertheless been greatly blessed. The harmony within the extended family, and the bonds of affection among all of us are witness to that.</p>

                        <section>
                        
                            <p>When Willi Schmid was murdered by the SS in Dachau Concentration Camp on the evening of June 30, 1934, I was a nine-and-a half year old fourth grader. It was a beautiful Saturday evening. Many of our apartment’s windows were open to the soft, summery air (no screens on the windows in Europe—you can stick your head out). My little room with its dark-green walls and white, multi-paned windows lining two of its sides, was immediately to the left of the apartment’s front door.  There was a place to hang coats opposite the door to my room: brass rods for hanging, with a place to put hats on a horizontal bar on top. Pushing all the coats aside one could stand between two facing mirrors and see one’s reflection to infinity, as we children pointed out to each other. On the right of that wardrobe, facing the front door and my room, was my father’s study.  I felt that to be a proper arrangement: I, the oldest child, was closest to his room. If Vati’s door was closed and I could hear conversation inside, I was expected not to knock for admission. If I could hear sounds of his practicing the gamba or the cello, I was allowed to enter, silently, on tiptoes, without knocking and could sit, with not a peep out of me, and listen. If there was no sound, I might knock if I needed to see him, and unless he was very busy he would let me come in and talk with him. When he had no time to spare he would tell me so in his loving voice— his voice, the source of security, my greatest comfort. I would be off, waiting for dinner or another time, and close the door behind me. The rule was absolute; it did not even occur to me to plead for an exception.</p>
        
                            <p>When Vati was away on one of his many trips, his study’s other door, which led to the sitting room, would be left open. One was permitted to go through that door and take out any of the many books to look at or read. The art books were the most accessible to a child, and I would turn the pages to look for illustrations (in those years mostly black and white) of things that caught my fancy. The books were not to be taken from the room. I was expected to put back in the right place whatever I had taken out. Kate estimated Vati’s library to contain about 6,000 books, so there was a reason for careful behavior.</p>
        
                            <p>One book I remember was a physical geography of Italy. My vocabulary was naturally childish, so when I came across a word for lowlands, Tiefebene, which is <em>tief</em> (low) and <em>Ebene</em> (plain), I read it as <em>tiefe</em> (low) <em>Bene</em> (a slang word for legs). I wasn’t exactly sure what low legs were doing in that region of Italy, but I read on in confident knowledge that I could check out anything puzzling with Vati. On the other hand, I was not prepared for being wrong about the pronunciation of the word in question, so that Vati’s smiling correction of low legs to low lands fell on my stony spirit, accompanied by the truculent suspicion that he might be mistaken. This need to assert myself has troubled me all my life; why not just accept? Yet whenever any occasion for disagreement with Vati arose, I was particularly troubled. His love, his good will, the skill with which he led his children through the dark and often dangerous forest of existence were truly the staff of life to us. My doubting him or my not being grateful for some kindness agitated my feelings profoundly, as the following incident illustrates.</p>
        
                            <p>During the bad times in Germany while I was becoming conscious of my father (born on December 13, 1924, I was seven to nine years old between 1931 and his death), I, as well as my little brother Thomi, had learned to be conscientious about asking for treats and presents. But, once when on a walk with Vati we passed a man with a cart from which he was selling bright Italian <em>gelati</em>, in cones shaped like little rowboats, whatever restraint I had was forgotten. I had to have an ice cream boat! So I asked whether I could have one of those <em>gelati</em>. My father looked embarrassed and said no, not today. Again I pleaded with strings of pleases, and my poor father, thinking perhaps of the germs on the <em>gelati</em> cart, who knows, took me inside a quite elegant café and ordered ice cream for me. It arrived in a footed silver dish and had two little <em>gaufrettes</em> stuck into a ball of ice cream. To me, though of course my greed made me eat every bite of it, it tasted like dust and ashes, because the boat, the most important ingredient, was missing. I thanked my father, as was appropriate for such an elegant treat, but my heart was not in it. Before I could go to sleep that night, over and over, I puzzled and fretted about the heartache caused by my inability to be thankful for a kindness shown, for love given. This troubled me for a long time after the event; I understood the love and kindness, but my heart was not warmed by it. It began to occur to me right then that heartache is part of the human condition: did it not accompany my interchange with the person I loved most in the world?</p>
        
                            <p>I loved my father with my whole heart. I still hear in my mind his comments at breakfast. He approved of my pigtails, <em>sauber gezöpft</em> (neatly braided). He admonished me to be a good girl, not wild. But unbeknownst to me he once wrote to Kate, “that one can see at a glance that Thomi and Dusch are…not goodie-goodies.” Each morning Vati traced a little cross on my forehead with his thumb, by way of a blessing, whether I was off to school or whether he was leaving on a trip. There were many trips, for research, for participation in performances in far-off cities, for tours with his viol quintet. We accepted his absences, but it was only when he was home that all was the way it should be.</p>
        
                            <p>What Vati taught me tended to stay in my mind, although I know he taught me a great deal that I have since forgotten. But I remember his firm hand on my right shoulder as, standing behind me, he let the water run a bit while saying “Let it run from the faucet till it runs cold, here, feel it yourself.” On thousands of occasions since then I have felt that protective, loving hand on my shoulder. Each time the water runs cold is an occasion of love remembered. Not that the advice was vital, but the unbreakable bond that inspired it was, and is.</p>
         
                            <p>On a walk in the spring woods in the Isartal, a lengthy park that reaches from Munich southward along the banks of the Isar, he showed me carpets of hepatica and cautioned me, “You mustn’t pick it, if you put it in a vase it just dies.” But another time when we found watercress in a cold brook near Schlederloh we picked away and ate the lovely stuff out of our hands, laughing and dripping.</p>
        
                            <p>On a winter night in Schlederloh, Vati took me by the hand and together we walked to a little clearing where, in the bitter cold, he showed me Orion, that most beautiful of constellations in our Northern winter sky, and spoke of the universe, the distance in time and space of the starlight, of eternity. There is a German song that we often sang as children that brings that night back to me in an almost physical sense:</p>
        
                            <p class="inset first"><em>Weisst du wieviel Sternlein stehen</em></p>
                            <p class="inset"><em>An dem blauen Himmelszelt?</em></p>
                            <p class="inset"><em>Gott der Herr has sie gezählet</em></p>
                            <p class="inset"><em>Dass ihm auch nicht eines fehlet</em></p>
                            <p class="inset last"><em>Von der ganzen, grossen Zahl.</em></p>
        
                            <p class="inset">Do you know how many stars</p>
                            <p class="inset">Can be found in the tent of the sky?</p>
                            <p class="inset">God the Lord has counted them all,</p>
                            <p class="inset">He has not missed a single one</p>
                            <p class="inset last">Of the whole great number.</p>
        
                            <p>Sky and heaven are, in German as in French and Italian, the same word. So the tent of the sky is also the tent of heaven, and Vati spoke a good deal with us about heaven, the dear Lord, <em>der liebe Gott,</em> never just God, always ‘dear’, who made all of our beautiful earth and its sky and stars, sun and moon. There are many German songs about the moon; we sang all the time. What Vati conveyed clearly to us, whether he spoke of God and His creation or sang with us, was the security of having a father in heaven in addition to our own father.</p>
        
                            <p>It is difficult to paint a picture of the now unimaginably homogeneous culture of the Bavaria in which we grew up. The Church calendar and its attendant holy days, feast days for saints, processions and times of penance or expectancy (as in Lent or Advent) dominated the region’s year. We children were only dimly aware of the Protestantism of Vati’s mother, Margarethe, her sister Tanti and their brother Onkel Hans, and completely unaware of the fact that Kate’s mother was Jewish. “Everyone,” we blithely assumed, was Catholic. And after New Year’s came the Three Kings, and then carnival, <em>Fasching,</em> with Mardi Gras, fat Tuesday, followed by Ash Wednesday and Lent, eventually succeeded by Good Friday and Holy Saturday, when the bells flew back from Rome, and then Easter. Any baby knew all that.</p>
        
                            <p>The Easter that stands out is one when I was about seven and Thomi about five. Kate was pregnant with Hedi, and stayed home, as did Oma Reta, as we called Vati’s mother. Pipsi, our grandfather, and Vati and we children got to go to the Hoinerhof, the Hoiner farm where the Schmids had spent their summers when Willi was a boy. We had been to the Hoiner, as it was called for short, before. It lies on the slope of a foothill of higher mountains facing the Tegernsee, with a view of the lake and within hearing of the bells of the former Benedictine monastery on the lakeshore. The farm family, the Berghammers (mountain-hammer, a name I pondered and admired much), were poor farmers on rocky, poor land, but they had the bearing and virtues of independent, competent, hard-working folk, backed by the knowledge that they had one of the most beautiful farmsteads far and near. At the bottom of the steep hill we had to climb to go to the Hoiner, Vati would yodel up to the Berghammers to let them know it was Willi on his way up — no phone needed, as if they had had one. On the mild, sunny Easter Sunday in question the trees were lacy with the first small sprouts of leaves and it was quiet, quiet.  Ours was a stony grass path trod by cows and humans. The sound of the bells floated up from the big monastery church down by the lake. The woods were full of crocus and early hepatica. Don’t pick it, I heard in my mind. But soon, with a little encouragement from Vati and Pipsi, Thomi and I spied unexpected treasures under the trees, cleverly disguised in crocus and hepatica colors: lilac and purple Easter eggs, and little nests with foil-wrapped chocolate bunnies and eggs. Time was suspended, the walk seemed to stretch infinitely; we were enchanted. Full of bliss, I thought: good that we brought baskets along. How lucky we were that the Berghammers live just above an enchanted forest inhabited by Easter bunnies. It is Easter, everything is perfect.</p>
                             
                            <p>On less solemn Sundays when we were home Vati sometimes let me come with him when he sang in the <em>Domchor</em>, the cathedral choir of Munich’s landmark Frauenkirche. We could see its two tall onion-domed towers from our house, and it was just a couple of stops on the trolley. Vati—of course! A man like that!—knew his way around the huge church, and would mount the stairs to the choir loft. I took entirely for granted that the singers and the musicians were glad to see him—what else? Why would they not welcome my affable father with his beautiful baritone voice, musical to the bone and both knowledgeable and unassuming. I would crouch behind the balustrade overlooking the huge nave while the music soared over the congregation. I knew that I must be “as still as a mouse,” one of those puzzling admonitions made by grown-ups. The mice I had observed were always running around like maniacs.</p>
        
                            <p>Sometimes, instead of taking the tram back after the service we walked along the Ludwigstrasse, past the Theatiner church, my favorite. It is said to be the oldest Baroque church north of the Alps, and in my childhood had the added virtue of sheltering the <em>Maroni-Frau,</em> an old woman with a little charcoal stove on which she roasted chestnuts that she sold in a twist of newspaper, a perfect treat on a cold winter morning.</p>
        
                            <p>I specially loved the times when our parents would walk with us in the evening, either by the Isar or in the <em>Englische Garten,</em> Munich’s big park (laid out by Benjamin Thompson from Woburn, Massachusetts—but that is another story). These walks were special, relatively rare, but a source of lively delight on my part. On most evenings Vati and Mutti went out, either because Vati had to review a concert, an opera or an opening of some sort for the paper, or to visit friends or go to a party. Our apartment was within walking distance of the opera and several concert venues, including the famous Cuvillier Theater. But if they had to go to the Prinzregenten Theater on the far side of the Isar, our parents would go by tram.  Only a few wealthy people in the Munich of the early thirties had cars. Though my parents wore evening dress as was customary for a festive performance, they were not a specially extraordinary sight on the trolley. Others heading for the theater were dressed in their finery. Some of the street car conductors would call out the title of the featured piece, just in case people thought the guy was not up on things: “<em>Missa Solemnis,</em> next stop.”</p>
        
                            <p>It was pleasant to be kissed goodnight before our parents left: they looked nicely groomed and smelled good. (We also liked a cosy, informal supper in the kitchen with the maids. No one cared about manners!) From before the time I knew the word beauty I knew that my mother was a beauty. I loved and admired her, and was as sure of her love as I was of Vati’s, but I did not take her for granted as I did my father’s whole being. You had to sort of live up to my mother. I knew that other people considered her beauty and allure her chief attributes. For us, those were just the beginning. She demanded concentration, effort, striving for fineness. But our walks in the dusk slowed her down to a tempo more congenial to me, and brought out her sensibility to nature and her gentlest aspects. Kate once wrote to Willi, in 1919, that a peaceful day at home was entirely in tune with her preference, “a day quieter than usual, not noisier.” She loved the peace of the early evening. The fading light and the quiet made our walks memorable, but what I prized above all was the feel of Vati’s firm hand holding mine, the flow of love streaming from hand to hand.</p>
        
                            <p>Willi’s love of music, his skill playing the violin, viola, cello and bass, his viols, and, in a pinch, our little piano or a church organ, made him a knowledgeable and careful critic. It suffused our family life with beauty. We children, needless to say, were not aware that there was anything the least unusual about the amount and quality of live music that floated through our consciousness, that lulled us to sleep at night, that lifted our hearts. The Bach cello suites were Vati’s staple; he played from them every day. The quintet rehearsing the especially crystalline early viol music, Julia Menz bringing a portable harpsichord for sonata rehearsals with Vati, that was all normal, and joyful and bracing as well. That music was the daily experience of our lives. I remember evening rehearsals best, going to sleep to the sounds of the viols. I also treasured the talk among the musicians. They spoke with joy about their project, the comfortable inflections of Bavarian German reflecting their ease with each other. Those evenings with Vati’s friends made our security palpable: the benevolent atmosphere, the peace of our house, a world of order and beauty. The men would advance opinions passionately but with careful courtesy, full of confidence in each other. I liked to observe the contrast between the ease of their relations with each other and the fierce attention, the focused tension of their playing, how their bodies expressed concentration, how they listened to each other, observed one another.</p>
        
                            <p>The level of musicianship was very high. Valentin Härtl, the violist, is the only member of the quintet of whom I know more than the name. He was a professor at Munich’s <em>Hochschule für Musik,</em> a very well known man. (One of his students was Walter Trampler, whom many of you knew.) Härtl was not one to suffer fools gladly, so the standard of the quintet must have been lofty.</p>
                               
                            <p>Vati had a picture of Bach by his desk, and we knew that that was a sacred being, as was Mozart. There was a whole host of others, classified by me as resembling the communion of saints, and helter-skelter in my head. Beethoven, Gombert, Caix d’Hervelois (I remember practicing to make those wonderful French syllables come out right), Schubert, Bruckner, Strauss (I fell in love with <em>Rosenkavalier</em> when I was eight and heard it on a recording somewhere: no recordings at home!) Scarlatti, Purcell (a surprise to me that there were English composers), Haydn, Telemann, Verdi — a multitude, a glory.</p>
        
                            <p>Vati was playing one of his Bach suites in the late afternoon of June 30, 1934. Our household on that Saturday consisted of my parents, my seven-year-old brother Thomi and my two-year-old sister Hedi, our mother’s mother Oma Hedi who was ill in bed, her daughter-in-law our Aunt Emmi, the two maids, Elisabeth, our nursemaid and general factotum and our beloved cook, Anni. I was reading in my room and had the door to the hall closed. It was shortly before supper. The two younger children and my aunt were somewhere at the other end of the apartment, Anni was in the kitchen and Vati was in his study. When the doorbell rang I never heard it, lost in my book. I did hear Anni going to answer it. Then I vaguely heard voices and heard Anni going to announce whoever it was to my father,  “Herr Doktor,” she said, as was proper in Germany at that time. Vati came out of his study after a while to greet whoever it was and, curious, I started into the hall, only to have Anni tell me so sharply to stay in my room that I retreated instantly, without argument. I caught a glimpse of Vati in profile, emerging from his study and going to the front door.</p>
        
                            <p>I could hear that there were several people coming in, could hear my mother’s voice sounding alarmed and Vati’s moderate voice in reply. I either did not hear or did not listen to more until I heard Vati leaving with what appeared to be a number of  people. He was asking to get his hat from the wardrobe rack. A respectable man leaving his house in 1934 needed a hat. That was the last time in my life that I heard his voice. My image of his fetching his hat and the characteristically precise but yet casual gesture with which he would put it on his head once outside the front door was utterly familiar, I had seen it hundreds of times. I did not see it then, except in my mind, and I never saw Vati again. “Where did Vati go?” I asked Anni. She did not know, and our mother was in the study with the doors closed talking on the phone, unreachable.</p>
        
                            <p>The rest of the evening is a blur in my mind. There was no supper that night, although I suppose we children must have been given something in the kitchen. I do recall the strawberry tart that Anni had made set on the sideboard in the dining room, giving off the wonderful fragrance of the little wild strawberries, fraises de bois. It sat there till some time the next day.  Not even greedy Duscha had the heart to filch some: all was mute, paralyzed, waiting for Vati’s footsteps, waiting for the telephone, waiting for word, waiting for a miracle.</p>
        
                            <p>The linden trees were in bloom all over Munich, and the sweet fragrance of their blossoms drifted into the silent house. Whenever I have caught that scent in the many summers that have passed since then, I am back at the Schackstrasse, suspended in time and silence.</p>
        
                            <p>I do not remember exactly when we children were told that Vati was dead. The enormity of such news is beyond one’s comprehension. The faces and tears of people around us reinforced the words, but none of it was real. I tried to make sense of it by thinking of Pipsi’s death the previous October. My beloved grandfather had been ill for some time. I would visit him and sit on a little stool by his high bed, with the big down comforter and many pillows. He frequently suffered from terrible hiccups, so he sat more than lay on his bed, and patiently tried out various cures (“Think of six bald men while holding your breath”) that I suggested to him for his hiccups. Then he would take my hand and stroke it and say Mei Weiberl (my little goodwife), and between his tormenting bouts of hiccups, we would both be comforted by the deep love between us. On the day he died I was tagging after Oma Reta, while Tante Elli, my father’s sister, was with Pipsi.  I can see her emerging from his room with tears streaming down her face. She said quietly, “Die Himmelstüren sind für ihn aufgegangen” (the doors of Heaven opened up for him).</p>
        
                            <p>Oma Reta took to her bed soon after Pipsi’s death, but lingered on until March 1934. I would sit on the same stool by her bed, and she would talk to me about the Kasperle, the Bavarian Pierrot, that she was making for Thomi. He was green and black with a pointy hat, and had pompoms down his front, and she asked my advice about the mouth she was embroidering on his face: smiling or plain? open or closed? When I asked her how she was, and when she would get better, she only said that she was so tired, very, very tired. We missed the grandparents after they died, but since they were so old, sixty-nine and sixty-two, I supposed that their deaths could be expected in the nature of things. But Vati!</p>
        
                            <p>The faithful Oehlers, our Swiss friends, arrived in Munich as soon as they heard the terrible news, to take Thomi and me to their home in Aarau. It must have been Wednesday or Thursday, July 5th or 6th. I know that before Vati’s funeral we flew from Munich to Zurich. Flying was still an exotic experience. We were fascinated and thrilled. I recall that first view of the earth from the sky—the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, Lake Constance and then the Swiss Alps and Zurich.</p>
        
                            <p>The magnitude of horror and shock with which Willi’s death overwhelmed Kate must have made her grateful for our safe removal from Munich. I can understand her acceptance of the Oehlers’ loving help, her need to avoid adding our emotional upheaval to her own. I cannot blame her, but how I wish at least I had been at the mass for Vati.</p>
        
                            <p>In Aarau the reality of Vati’s death was still slower to dawn on us—we were used to being at the Blumenhalde, the Oehlers’ estate, without Vati. I can tell you the day I came to comprehend that our father was really dead. Thomi had his seventh birthday on July 12. I remember nothing of the day except my gentle brother sitting with his big present, his new Lederhosen, the real thing, buckskin. Vati had still picked them out for him. Thomi sat, dreaming into space, with his new shorts on his lap. He was stroking the leather, and soundless tears were flowing down his cheeks. He wiped them away from time to time so they would not drip on the buckskin. It broke my heart to see him stroking the shorts. Now I could understand it, now I knew. Vati was dead, we would never see him again until we died ourselves.</p>
        
                            <div class="rest"></div>
        
                            <p>The best source for the facts concerning Willi’s arrest and death is Kate’s own description of events. With the help of Walter Schmid and Franz Ringler, her brothers-in-law, she prepared two versions of her story, dated July 16 and August 1, 1934. They differ slightly, but since both were completed within a month of the murder, they present her immediate view of what happened. A singular attribute concerning these original documents is that the identity of their addressees is uncertain. Did Kate record her experience for the sake of future accuracy, or for presentation to the government? Did she intend them for her dealings with the Nazi party at its Munich headquarters, the <em>Braunes Haus</em> (Brown House)? We can only guess.</p>
        
                            <p>The first version of Kate’s portrayal of June 30 is typed single-spaced, written in the passive voice. This version will be found in the appendix since you do not need both versions except for comparison. The second version, included here, appears to me to be much more typical of my mother. A revised version of this description is dated August 1, 1934, and exists in three slightly different copies. It tells the story in the first person, again edited in pencil. I will include the corrections but want to state at the outset that some of the strongest language, which I assume to be Kate’s rewrite of the July 16 version, is softened by penciled revisions. I do not know whether the final version was typed, nor to whom the document is addressed. If it was meant to be simply a record, why is the language moderated in a number of instances? It is of course possible that Kate was afraid of a house search, yet since the original strong words remain perfectly legible, that supposition makes no sense. I find this second version with its vigorous language preferable to the original, and much more typical of my clear-headed, outspoken mother. It contains none of the ‘officialese’ that occasionally jars the original.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">I.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">On June 30, 1934, at 7:20 in the evening, my husband, the music writer and editor of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten (MNN),</em> Dr. Willi Schmid, was arrested by a civilian and four SS men in uniform in our apartment, Schackstrasse 3/III, in the presence of myself and my children. No warrant for arrest was shown, nor did the arresting men present any identification. Our request to state a reason for the arrest was refused, as was my offer to give my husband his identification papers to take along. Immediately after my husband was taken away I telephoned the Political Police and again offered to present my husband’s identification papers.  That also did not meet with success. A Munich SS man, Baron Rechberg, had been requisitioned with his automobile by the arresting personnel.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">II.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">After my husband’s arrest I spent three days, in person and on the telephone, to determine something about my husband’s fate. I was turned away everywhere. It was not until the managing director of the <em>MNN,</em> <em>Landrat</em> [District Magistrate] Haniel, who was called from Düsseldorf, interfered that we received the news from the Political Police on the afternoon of Tuesday, July 3, “Dr. Willi Schmid met his death on July 1.”</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">III.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">On the same day, that is, Tuesday, July 3, the Political Police in response to Landrat Haniel granted permission for public burial of my husband. The body, in a coffin, was turned over to two gentlemen from the <em>MNN</em> (one of whom was Captain Schenk) under a railroad pass near Dachau. It was then transferred to the East Cemetery by municipal hearse. On the next day the coffin proved to be closed in such a manner that opening it was impossible. Therefore nothing concerning the state of the body could be determined. Concerning the body’s identity one had to believe the inscription in blue chalk: “Dr. Willi Schmid.” I could not put a death notice in the newspapers because the Political Police asked me to lie. I was to write that my husband had died in consequence of an accident. Also, the time of the funeral was not to be stated. Therefore the only death notice was submitted by the editorial offices of the MNN; it contained the lie concerning the accident.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">IV.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">On Saturday, July 7, that is a week after my husband’s death, a representative of the Political Police, a certain Regierungsrat [Senior Civil Servant] Brunner appeared at my apartment in order to express his condolences to me and to my husband’s brother. We were denied answers to a number of questions. The sum total of Herr Brunner’s statement was simply, “Dr. Willi Schmid was arrested because he was suspected of participating in subversive machinations against the State. Transferred to Dachau Concentration Camp he met his death through an unfortunate accident.”</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">V.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">During Herr Brunner’s visit on July 7, I told him that a number of valuables that my husband had with him were missing. Herr Brunner promised to obtain these things for me. That promise has not been fulfilled to date, i.e. four weeks after my husband’s death.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">VI.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">On Saturday, July 14, I was handed a death certificate, and that not by the Political Police, but by the <em>MNN.</em> According to that my husband is supposed to have been shot on Saturday, June 30, 1934 at six in the afternoon; that would have been more than an hour before he was arrested.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">VII.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">To date, I have not received any official communication whatever that would indicate what consequence the State intends to draw from the unjustified killing of my husband. I do not know whether the responsible perpetrators will be brought to justice, nor what the State plans to do about my children and me. The Political Police has referred me to the editor-in-chief of the <em>MNN,</em> Herr Hausleiter.  Since my husband was arrested by State authorities, I must of course refuse to negotiate with private parties concerning the result of that arrest. Incidentally Herr Hausleiter has made no effort of any kind to get in touch with me.</p>
        
                            <h5 class="inset">VIII.</h5>
                            <p class="inset">My husband had learned several hours before his arrest, that is at noon of June 30, in the editorial offices of the <em>MNN,</em> that SA Gruppenführer Willi Schmid had been shot. There therefore could not have been a mistake concerning the arrest and killing of my husband.</p>
                            <p class="inset first last">My husband, who served four years in the war and was severely wounded (disabled by an abdominal wound) never belonged to a political party and was never politically active.</p>
        
                            <p>A few corrections of consequence are the following: in Version I, an alternative sentence in Section I reads: “When I offered to give my husband his identity papers to take along, I was threatened with a revolver.” In Section III the entire paragraph concerning Kate’s refusal to put in a death notice because she was asked to lie is missing in Copies 2 and 3.</p>
        
                            <p>In Section V Copies 2 and 3 list the valuables: “my husband’s wedding ring, the gold watch, gold-rimmed glasses, change purse and other objects.” A paragraph is added, “On Wednesday, July 4, the deceased’s desk in the editorial offices of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> was searched by the Political Police without result.  The house was never searched.” In Section VI a sentence was added: “This false document was issued by the Prittelbach town officials on the authorization of Herr Regierungsrat Kellner.” In Section VII the second sentence is amended in pencil as follows: “I neither know whether an investigation was instigated….  Children aged 9, 7 and 2….” Also inserted after “Since my husband was arrested” is “and lost his life….” In Section VIII, the entire paragraph concerning SA Gruppenführer Willi Schmid is crossed out. A penciled correction is added after Willi’s war record: “which is why he was only in the SA Auxiliary.”  This is not an indication of any kind of participation by Willi in the SA. It is the result of the Nazi take-over of veterans’ organizations. Willi had belonged to the conservative <em>Stahlhelm</em> (Steel Helmet). The simplest explanation for this is also the most probable: a fellow veteran must have asked him to join, and he most likely did not want to turn down an old comrade. The Stahlhelm was far more rightist than Willi, and there is not a syllable in any of Willi’s letters that would indicate active participation in its proceedings. I suppose Uncle Walter and Kate thought that mentioning the SA Auxiliary might in some way be a shield from the Nazis. But how?</p>
        
                            <p>Below the date of August 1, 1934, in Copies 2 and 3 another sentence is added which in Copy 3 is numbered X (although there is no IX): “On July 31, 1934, the Deputy Führer, Minister Hess, appeared at the widow’s apartment and officially expressed his condolences.”</p>
        
                            <p>Hess was a most unstable hero-worshipper of Hitler. You can read about his famous flight to Scotland in 1941, probably to negotiate peace with British appeasers on his own hook (Hitler immediately declared him insane). This strange, deluded man wrote Kate the following letter on September 24, 1934:</p>
        
                            <h5 class="newsClippings first">The Deputy Führer</h5>
                            <h5 class="newsClippings">National Socialist German Workers’ Party</h5>

                            <p class="newsClippings first">Esteemed Madam,</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings">I have been informed that, particularly with regard to your children, you would like to have confirmed in writing what I already told you during my visit.  It concerns the fact that your <em>Herr Gemahl</em> (formal: spouse) was not shot because he was involved in the Röhm revolt or was in any way culpable. He was indeed the victim of an accident. As I already assured you, care has been taken particularly in connection with the tragic death of your <em>Herr Gemahl</em> that, insofar as is humanly possible, such an accident will not recur. That, so to speak, is the legacy of your late <em>Herr Gemahl</em> which reaches beyond the inner circle of family and friends.</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings">With renewed expression of my sincere sympathy,</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings">Yours very truly,</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings signature">R. Hess</p>
        
                            <p>I should add that the original of this letter is lost, as Kate states in her 1945 deposition. What we have is a carbon copy of a notarized copy.</p>
                            <p>As strange a man as Hess was, both his visit and letter displayed uniquely unusual behavior in the wake of June 30. Kate’s fearlessness made her stand out among the victims. Willi’s murder received unprecedented publicity. In those days of her greatest trial (“I am going through the worst days of my life” she wrote to Willy Merkl on July 2, 1934), her discipline, determination and energy were, as can happen in such circumstances, almost superhuman. With astounding self-possession she, on the very day she was notified of his death, insisted that the coffin with Willi’s body be released to her for a proper funeral.</p>
        
                            <p>The funeral itself took place three days later, on July 6. It was crowded with people despite the fact that its time and location were not announced in the newspapers. The death notice in the <em>MNN</em> reads:</p>
                            <h5 class="newsClippings">Friday, July 6, 1934</h5>
                            <p class="newsClippings">In deepest sorrow we announce that our dear colleague, Dr. Willi Schmid, editor and music critic of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> has been taken from our midst far too soon in consequence of an accident. We shall always cherish the memory of this upright man, this splendid writer, and this kind human being.</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings first">The Publishers and Editors<br/>
                            Of the <em>Münchner Neüste Nachrichten</em><br/>
                            Knorr and Hirth</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings first last">Mass Saturday 9 a.m. at St. Ludwig</p>
        
                            <p class="first">Right above the death notice appeared the report of a speech by the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Siebert. It unhesitatingly and emphatically backs the Nazi line: “The judicial measures had to be taken to show how great the danger was… The Führer fought the most challenging battle of his life… whoever witnessed it realized the absolute necessity of assisting this ideal figure [Hitler] in achieving his ideas.” I find it almost beyond belief that a high government official can call multiple murders “judicial measures,”  and either be utterly blind to Hitler’s ruthlessness or deliberately lie to his audience.</p>
        
                            <p>An obituary that, I believe, appeared in the same edition of the paper as the death notice reads:</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings first">In deep shock we wish to announce that our extraordinarily gifted colleague, Dr. Willi Schmid, editor and music critic of our publication, was suddenly taken from our midst due to an accident.  The few lines of our obituary can barely suggest what Willi Schmid meant for Munich’s musical and artistic life. As he was himself a professional musician he could fathom and encompass the entire range of musical life and musical creativity. He was a critic of deep and refined insight into musical questions and personalities, and an excellent stylist who at the same time knew how to speak to a wide range of readers in universally comprehensible terms. His insights into Munich’s musical scene in particular were especially valuable and acclaimed. He was also highly regarded abroad, particularly in Italy and Switzerland, where his recent reports on the Othmar-Schöck-Week created quite a stir. His open, friendly and affable ways won for him the hearts of all who knew him well. All his colleagues praised his readiness to help and assist, and his considerate manner of lending a hand where needed. A soldier in the war, he was among the bravest. A serious injury disabled him severely.</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">Descended from an old Munich family, Willi Schmid was born in Weilheim on April 12, 1893. His university studies were augmented by studies at the Academy of Music. His love for ancient music dates from that time. This was the music, and in particular that of the seventeenth century, which he presented with his viol quintet to acquaint current audiences with it. He had been the reviewer for our paper for a year and had exercised his responsibilities from the worthy perspective of a promoter of musical life. Our readers will clearly recall the outstanding essays he wrote. Our paper will not forget this departed colleague, this likeable man.</p>
        
                            <p>The <em>MNN</em> carried a somewhat disjointed report on Saturday, July 7, titled “Willi Schmid’s Funeral.” It relates that:</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings first">A large number of mourners had assembled in the sanctuary of Munich’s East Cemetery to pay respects to the memory of the music critic Dr. Willi Schmid. Editors and other members of the Knorr and Hirth Publishing Company, including Managing Director Haniel, had gathered to take leave of the music reviewer of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> who was torn from productive life by an accident. Many well-known musicians and artists were present, as were friends of the deceased and ecclesiastics. The service began with music from Mozart’s Requiem played by those friends of Schmid with whom he had formed a quintet. (A wreath from these friends also decorated the grave.) Subsequently Dr. Peter Dörfler approached the flower-laden bier to commemorate the dead man.  The moving as well as highly polished address reflected Dörfler as both the priest and the writer. He described Schmid as having reached manhood during the stormy times of the war. Going to war in 1914 and serving on the front lines in the West, in Italy, Serbia and the Carpathian Mountains, Schmid experienced the terrors of war. Once he returned he brought the powers of his intellect to bear on cultural values.  He was able to strengthen peaceful connections through the power of German music, which he conveyed as far as southern Italy. From his early youth he grew up under the guidance of the muses. The clerical speaker supplemented the eulogy of the human being and the man with exalted thoughts and the consolations of Christianity for the bereaved. “We will look beyond the grave, over which the Easter sun of the Resurrection shines, which alters all mourning and bitterness.”</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">The director of the publishing company, Dr. Friedrich Trefz, expressed the profound sympathy of the publishers of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten.</em> Although the merits of the deceased had already been honored in the paper, the speaker once more emphasized Schmid’s achievements in his role as a constructive, encouraging critic, a role that can be fraught with numerous chances for misunderstandings. Schmid had come by his love for music and art as an inherited legacy of his native Bavaria. In recent times his thoughts had wandered off to far-off India and the Himalayas, where some of his friends were tackling the conquest of Nanga Parbat, to create a monument to German enterprise and perseverance. The leader of the expedition, Willy Merkl, had asked Schmid to publicize reports and photographs of the undertaking in the German press. Dr. Trefz laid a wreath at the bier as an outward sign of remembrance.</p>
                             
                            <p class="newsClippings">Editor-in-chief Leo Hausleiter remembered the departed in plain and impressive words. Retired Major Müller dedicated a wreath to his departed comrade with a dedicatory ribbon from Detachment 3 of the National Socialist Veterans’ Association (Stahlhelm), Group Munich-East. In the name of the German Society for Christian Art, Deputy Fackeldey added a flower tribute for his esteemed co-worker.</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">A classical tune, played by Christian Döbereiner, Schmid’s teacher, furnished a worthy epilogue to the ceremony in the hall. Thereupon the long procession of mourners moved on its way to the laurel-surrounded grave. There, following the prayers of the priest, many last tributes of flowers accompanied the clods of earth.</p>
        
                            <p>The piece refers to Willi’s fellow musicians playing “a piece of Mozart’s Requiem.” I believe that was a reportorial error, since Kate always told us that they had played the slow movement of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xRqiAj-3UM" target="_blank">G minor Quintet, K.516.</a> Willi’s part would have been played by Hermann von Beckerath. I do not know what the “classical tune” played by Döbereiner was.</p>
        
                            <p>One other point in the report caught my attention. “Editor-in-chief Hausleiter remembered the departed in plain and impressive words.” Hausleiter, the Nazi replacement for the paper’s former editor, was a man Kate thoroughly disliked and mistrusted. Hausleiter had become editor-in-chief through the intervention of Hess and Himmler, head of the SS and Chief of Police in Munich. Hausleiter had previously held a minor post in a publishing house and worked for the Nazi party as an informant.</p> 
        
                            <p>To hear Hausleiter, of all people, speak at Willi’s funeral must have outraged Kate, but she would of course have been helpless to prevent it. I know that at one time Kate suspected Hausleiter of having placed Willi’s name on a list of “unreliables,” which the SS might have used for its bloody purpose. 
                            I would like to include here a letter dated June 12, 1933, signed by Josef Magnus Wehner, a mildly Nazified writer of the time. He writes:</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings first">Shadowy intrigues against Dr. Willi Schmid cause me to declare the following: I have known Dr. Schmid for ten years. I warrant with my person and my honor that I have never heard of a comment or any action that could be seen in any sense to be anti-national. I know Dr. Schmid as a true patriot who suffered through the last years of German indignity. He never hid his sentiments and acknowledged them inside and outside the country.  What he did in a practical way for the German spirit, here and abroad, a shady informer cannot, of course, conceive. But as far as I am concerned I consider it an honor to be the friend of such a man.</p>
        
                            <p>I have no idea what Wehner might have meant by “shadowy intrigues.”  Ian Kershaw, the British historian, writes very perceptively about this aspect of the atmosphere in Germany.  The repression that was a “constant sword over people’s heads, the surveillance, harassment and intimidation” which threatened maltreatment of “protective custody” as a prelude to Dachau made for a cowed populace, one that no longer dared to speak out. It also encouraged informers, who were responsible for more arrests by the Political Police than that organization’s own researchers. Kershaw is very careful to say that anyone who never experienced Nazism “may expect standards of behavior…well-nigh impossible to attain in the circumstances.”<span class="citation">2</span> We still do not know what the shadowy intrigues might have been and we will have to leave it at that.</p>
        
                            <p>Willi’s funeral mass was held on Saturday, July 7, at St. Ludwig. That was our family church, set on the Ludwigstrasse right beside the University. It is a Gothic Revival building of dubious architectural distinction, but its blue ceiling with its gold stars endeared it to me when I sat dreaming through Sunday mass. I heard later that the Ludwigskirche had been crowded with people for Vati’s mass, despite the Political Police presence that took note of who came.</p>
        
                            <p>In the meantime, news of Willi’s murder had appeared in the foreign press. The London Times of July 7, 1934, carried the following piece:</p>
        
                            <h5 class="newsClippings first">methods of nazi  executioners</h5>
                            <h5 class="newsClippings">from our correspondent</h5>
                            <p class="newsClippings first"><em>Munich, July 6</em><br/>
                            The reappearance of foreign, and especially Swiss, newspapers at the Munich stalls is an indication that the worst facts about the events of the week-end have come out. As far as can be ascertained, the complete death-roll in Bavaria is 20, including the seven shot as conspirators at Stadelheim (a Munich prison) on Saturday.</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">A sinister light is thrown on the methods of the executioners by an obituary notice which appears in to-day’s <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> of a young musical critic named Dr. Willi Schmid, who is announced to have died in consequence of “an accident”. It appears that the accident was a mistake of identity, and that he was executed. Another man of the name Schmid was among the Stadelheim victims.</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">Dr. Willi Schmid’s is the only obituary notice that has been allowed by the authorities. In the case of Dr. Fritz Beck, Director of the German and Foreign Academic Exchange Bureau, a police order sent to the relatives forbidding them to announce the fact of his death, which, contrary to an earlier report, was a murder of a particularly revolting kind by black-shirted students, who took advantage of Captain Röhm’s disappearance to settle an old score of a private character. <em>[The article continues, citing rumors which are extraneous to our purpose here.]</em></p>
        
                            <p>Later in the month, on July 20, 1934, the (Manchester) <em>Guardian Weekly</em> carried the following article:</p>

                            <p class="newsClippings"><em>(From our Geneva Correspondent)</em><br/>
                            The <em>Nazionalzeitung</em> of Basle gave last week particulars of the murder at Munich on June 30 of Dr. Willi Schmid, the well-known and popular musical critic of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten,</em> which is said to have been due to a mistake.</p>
                            <p>The chief officer of a detachment of the S.S. had received orders to shoot a superior officer called Willi Schmid, who was attached to Röhm’s staff, and sent his men to the house of the musical critic. When they arrived they found Dr. Schmid playing the piano [no, of course not, the cello] and, in spite of his protestations of innocence carried him off to a prison, where he was shot. It was then discovered that the other Willi Schmid had been shot about three hours earlier.</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings">It was announced in the Munich papers, including the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten,</em> that Dr. Schmid had been killed by an accident, and the truth came out only at his funeral on July 6, when the pastor referred to the matter in his address.</p>
                            <p class="newsClippings">Dr. Schmid leaves a widow and three children, the youngest of whom is about a year old.</p>
        
                            <p>A fragmentary clipping from a Swiss paper, which may have been the Basle paper cited by the Guardian, or the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, contained the following:</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings first">Shocked Swiss friends of Dr. Willi Schmid have received the news that this man who lived only for his art died at the age of 41, an innocent victim of the events of June 30 in Munich. Readers of music journals both here and abroad knew Schmid from his essays and reports as one of the most acute minds writing on music in Germany, and as an intellect of strong character, open to everything genuine and beautiful. He was able to draw on his extensive fund of knowledge, profound musical talent and scholarship, to arrive at his incorruptibly straightforward and sound opinions, which he presented in a particularly refined linguistic style. Schmid was closely connected to Switzerland where he frequently spent time by ties of personal friendship as well as by his regular contributions to the <em>Schweizerische Musikzeitung</em> [Swiss Music Journal] which just recently published a piece, “Richard Strauss and Munich” which demonstrated the subtlest possible sympathetic understanding on Schmid’s part. His refined appreciation for Swiss ways and Swiss art was shown a few weeks ago in a warm-hearted essay (extensively cited by the <em>Neue Zürcher Zeitung</em>) concerning Othmar Schöck, which Schmid wrote, based on his impressions of the Berne Festival Week, for the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten,</em> whose music editor he was.</p>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">Schmid was one of the pioneers who helped to revive the ancient art of viol-playing—his work with his chamber ensemble for ancient music was known far and wide as exemplary. For him personally, this many-sided, cultivated spirit, it represented relaxation and refreshment after the demanding work of criticism that was his daily task.  Schmid also made a respected name for himself as the editor of ancient choral music. Among German music writers he was among the best and most reliable… <em>[Article cut off.]</em></p>
        
                            <p>There is a further note in an undated fragment of the <em>Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ)</em>:</p>
                            <h5 class="newsClippings first">the shooting of willi schmid</h5>
        
                            <p class="newsClippings">In number 1244 of the <em>NZZ</em> we reported that the music critic of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em>, Dr. Willi Schmid, was shot in connection with the events of June 30 in Munich due to a mix-up of names. According to the more or less official version that was circulated in Munich, Dr. Willi Schmid was the victim of mistaken identity confusing him with the SA Gruppenführer Wilhelm Schmid who was involved in the “Röhm-Revolt” and was shot at Stadelheim prison on June 30. A knowledgeable source pointed out to us that this version of mistaken identity sounded somewhat unlikely. A case of mistaken identity undoubtedly exists, but it may be assumed with considerable certainty that the command to execute which was mistakenly carried out on the music critic of the paper was really meant for Paul Schmidt, the former associate director of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten.</em> Last summer Paul Schmidt had, with the consent of the Political Police, been installed provisionally as associate director of the publishing company of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten,</em> but in consequence of various incidents fell into opposition to the Political Police and withdrew from the firm in the spring of this year.</p>
        
                            <p>It is no wonder that there was speculation abroad about the facts of any death connected with June 30. The Nazis had tried hard to conceal some of the more grisly aspects of that night of murder. But the untimely death of a former chancellor, two generals, a prominent Catholic politician and many more, ninety individuals altogether, was impossible to hush up. This is probably an appropriate place to pause for a look at the larger significance of what came to be known as the Night of the Long Knives. June 30, 1934, is an important date in Hitler’s progress toward absolute tyranny over the German people. Much has been written about it. An accessible, clear analysis is given by Kershaw who states that at that time Hitler’s “remaining obstacles to absolute power” were the SA, the brown-shirted storm troopers, on the one hand, and the Reichswehr, the influential German army, on the other.</p>
        
                            <p>By 1934 membership in the SA had grown to four and a half million men, a huge para-military force which had been “violent and lawless to an unbelievable degree” after Hitler’s access to power in 1933. It was headed by Ernst Röhm, a close friend of Hitler with military ambitions for his band of bullies and hooligans. Many of these had been bitterly disappointed that the success of the Nazi revolution did not yield plushy jobs or status for the average SA-man. With some exceptions they were an angry bunch of malcontents and rowdies, generally feared and looked down upon.</p>
        
                            <p>The <em>Reichswehr,</em> on the other hand, saw itself as upholding the great Prussian military tradition, and wanted by all means to retain its powerful position vis-à-vis any German government. The army feared the SA’s military pretensions, and intended to do all in its power to persuade Hitler to side with the <em>Reichswehr</em> against the SA. General Blomberg, the Minister of Defense from 1933 to 1938, was so eager to persuade Hitler to side with the <em>Reichswehr</em> that he voluntarily introduced the Nazi emblem as part of the army uniform, and accepted the “Aryan paragraph”—no Jewish officers in the army—which led to the dismissal of seventy officers.</p>
        
                            <p>Göring, Himmler and his side-kick Heydrich of the notorious Sicherheitsdienst (security service) were all involved in machinations, including distributing fake documents attributed to the SA, to bring action against the SA to a head. They could count on the German judicial system; Franz Gürtner had been Bavarian Minister of Justice in the 1920s and had been instrumental in allowing the Nazi party to be legalized soon after Hitler’s 1923 <em>Putsch</em> against the Weimar Republic.</p>
        
                            <p>Kershaw writes that by June 1934, “Heydrich’s Sicherheitsdienst—the part of the labyrinthine SS organization responsible for internal surveillance—and the Gestapo were working overtime to concoct alarmist reports of an imminent SA putsch.” Generals Blomberg and Reichenau showed Hitler an “order” that Kershaw calls “a near-certain fake” by which Röhm allegedly ordered the SA to arm for an attack on the <em>Reichswehr.</em> Kershaw states that, “For all their surliness, the SA had never contemplated [a <em>putsch</em>], yet “the entire Reichswehr leadership…were prepared for imminent action.” He continues, “The <em>Reichswehr</em> made weapons and transport available to the SS,” in order to eliminate the SA. The SS, the Blackshirts, were numerically much smaller than the SA, but in the long run much more dangerous.</p>
        
                            <p>Himmler and Heydrich, two unspeakably depraved men, were in the process of building the greatest instrument of terror in the Nazi state, subsuming the SD and the secret police, the Gestapo. In the early hours of June 30 Hitler had rushed to Munich to initiate the purge of the undesirable storm troopers. He is described as being “in a blind rage” and “in a frenzy of rage.” He convinced himself that Röhm and various lesser SA officials were traitors. He called their behavior “the worst treachery in world history,” ripped insignia off their uniforms at the <em>Braunes Haus,</em> the Nazi party headquarters in Munich, and announced that all co-conspirators would be shot. Six SA leaders were shot immediately, despite the fact that they were being held at Stadelheim prison, disarmed and locked up. Not even a peremptory trial was held. These shootings unleashed a blood bath. Göbbels was the messenger. He called Göring with the password, <em>“Kolibri”</em> [hummingbird], that set in motion murder squads in Berlin and the rest of Germany. The former chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, was shot in the study of his house along with his wife. Another man was found dead in a ditch near the Oranienburg Concentration Camp. Gustav Ritter von Kahr, a former minister president of Bavaria, was “found hacked to death near Dachau.”</p>
        
                            <p>Röhm himself, who was, among all the Nazi bigwigs, once Hitler’s closest friend, was given an extra day of life and a chance to shoot himself. He evidently could not believe his fate, and refused to kill himself. So Commander Eicke of Dachau Concentration Camp and one other man shot Röhm point-blank in his prison cell at Stadelheim Prison. In Dachau, Willi did not even make it to a cell. He was shot in the detention room.</p>
        
                            <p>Of the ninety people murdered on June 30, only fifty were in fact SA men. The other forty victims included many who were simply opposed to the Nazis on political or religious grounds and completely innocent of conspiracy. Various Nazis used June 30 to revenge themselves on old opponents, or simply to remove people they found to be inconvenient. The evidence that these murders were committed with government backing is appalling enough. Even more appalling is the fact that there was barely a murmur of criticism, let alone outrage, from the German army, the judiciary, political circles or the press.</p>
        
                            <p>The nearly constant economic crisis since the end of the war, the political inexperience of the people, their preference for authoritarian government, the churches’ insistence on the terrors of godless communism, all these factors aggravated ordinary Germans’ fears. Hitler’s instant and ruthless suppression of dissent had begun in February of 1933, the month following his ascent to power. A mysterious fire at the Reichstag, the seat of the German parliament in Berlin, had played into his hands. The day after the fire a law, “one of the main legal foundations of the National Socialist rule,” had passed parliament: the “Decree for the Protection of the People and the State,” generally called “the Reichstag Fire Decree.” This gave the government  “further power to shut down the presses of left-wing parties, to forbid every publication by the opposition, to break up campaign rallies [an election was coming up], and to arrest opponents at will.  It also annulled almost all of the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution. The mere spreading of ‘rumors and false reports’ was now a treasonable offence… every voice of protest and every attempt at resistance in the face of terror after the Reichstag fire were quashed ‘entirely legally.’”<span class="citation">3</span></p>
        
                            <p>As if that were not bad enough, the Reichstag passed on March 23, 1933, a law called “Law to Remove the Danger to the People and the Reich,” known in common parlance as the Enabling Act. This gave the government emergency powers to circumvent the legislature.  It was the end of Germany as a constitutional state. The Nazis succeeded in interpreting the Reichstag fire as an emergency, a threatened Communist uprising. No such thing threatened, but the decree was passed “to defend the State against Communist acts of violence.” Müller writes, “What was actually decreed was the loss of all personal rights during the Third Reich. The freedom of the individual, the inviolability of the home from unwarranted search, the privacy of the mails, freedom of speech and assembly, the right to form organizations and even the right to earn property were suspended ‘until further notice.’ ‘Further notice’ did not come until May 8, 1945 [the day of Germany’s unconditional surrender].”<span class="citation">4</span></p>
        
                            <p>To abet this assault on civil rights, all Jewish attorneys had been excluded from the bar as of April 7, 1933. Dachau Concentration Camp, the first of the camps, opened in the spring of 1933 under the command of an SS leader, Theodor Eicke, “a pioneer in the bureaucratization of terror.”<span class="citation">5</span> June 30 was followed by a breathtaking capitulation on the part of the Reichstag marking a crucial point in Hitler’s road to tyranny.  Kershaw calls his chapter on these events “Securing Total Power.”  While abroad, “there was a horror at the butchery, even more so at the gangster methods by the State’s leaders.”<span class="citation">6</span> Within Germany people from General Blomberg and Reich President Hindenburg on down expressed gratitude and admiration for Hitler’s determination and courage in “rescuing” Germany from danger.</p>
        
                            <p>Hitler’s account of “the plot” was accepted as truth. On July 3 the cabinet passed a law that Dr. Otto Gritschneder in his 1993 book, <em>Der Führer hat Sie zum Tode verurteilt</em> (The Führer Condemned You to Death) calls “unique in the entire history of German law.” This “Law for the Emergency Defense of the State” consisted of a single paragraph that read: “The measures taken on June 30, 1934 and on July 1 and 2 for the suppression of high treasonable and State treasonable attacks are, as emergency defense of the State, legal.” The law was signed by Hitler, Frick, the Minister of the Interior, and Gürtner, the Minister of Justice. Without dissent, despite the fact that ex post facto law constitutes the gravest offense against the very concept of law, this outrage was willingly tolerated and, in Gritschneder’s words, “was instantly understood the way it was intended, that is, that the justice system was to keep its hands off anything to do with June 30.”<span class="citation">7</span> Kershaw writes, “the law acknowledging Hitler’s right to commit murder in the interest of the state was instantly accepted.”<span class="citation">8</span></p>
        
                            <p>Even Hitler, however, evidently felt some obligation to account to the Reichstag for his actions. He took his time about it; the address was given on July 13.<span class="citation">9</span> Kershaw goes on to explain, “The atmosphere was tense. Thirteen members of the Reichstag had been among those murdered…After he had offered a lengthy, fabricated account of the ‘revolt’…he came to the most extraordinary sections of the speech. In these, the head of the German government openly accepted full responsibility for what amounted to mass murder. Hitler turned the defense into attack. “…if I am reproached with not turning to the law-courts for sentence, I can only say, in this hour, I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and thereby the supreme judge (oberster Gerichtsherr) of the German people…” The cheering was tumultuous. Not just among the Reichstag members, but in the country at large, Hitler’s ruthless substitution of the rule of law by murder…was applauded. It matched exactly what Nazi parlance dubbed the ‘healthy sentiments of the people’.”<span class="citation">10</span> The official Reichstag minutes regarding Hitler’s sentence about being the supreme judge of the German people records “long-lasting thunderous applause.  The audience rises and bursts into tumultuous shouts of Heil!” At the end of what Gritschneder calls “this macabre session of the Reichstag,” the members pass a resolution which “acknowledges the justice of the declaration by the Reich government, and thanks the Reich chancellor for his energetic and resolute action in saving the fatherland from civil war and chaos.” Again the minutes record, “Thunderous applause.  The delegates rise while shouting uproarious Heils.”<span class="citation">11</span> No one appears to have remained calm or to have thought about the legal implications.</p>
        
                            <p>“There was no show of disapproval of Hitler’s state murders from any quarter. Both churches remained silent. Blomberg forbade officers to attend Schleicher’s funeral. Only one...disobeyed...As for any sign that the legal profession might distance itself from acts of blatant illegality, the foremost legal theorist in the country, Carl Schmitt, published an article directly relating to Hitler’s speech on July 13. Its title was: ‘The Führer Protects the Law.’”<span class="citation">12</span></p>
        
                            <p class="rest">Dr. Gritschneder’s book is an indispensable source of facts concerning the ninety victims of the Night of the Long Knives. Gritschneder, a lawyer and former Munich city councilor, is a meticulously sharp reporter. Forbidden by the Nazis to practice his profession because of his “political unreliability” and forcibly drafted into the German army, he is admirably outspoken. His analysis of the Nazis’ murky circumlocutions is a tonic. He bluntly confronts the failure of the Reichstag deputies, the justice system, the army and the churches to face up to the tyrannical nature of Hitler’s regime, and the failure to remove him from office while there was still time. He chronicles the blindness of a range of German institutions to recognize in June 30 a major turning point in Hitler’s gain of absolute power.</p>
        
                            <p>You who are reading this have grown up in freedom, so I feel compelled to take you a bit further into details of the Nazi German environment, particularly in regard to German law and justice, and freedom, or rather the lack of freedom, during Nazi times. I recommend reading O.J. Hale, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Captive-Press-Princeton-Legacy-Library/dp/0691618976">The Captive Press in the Third Reich,</a></em> and Ingo Müller’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Justice-Courts-Third-Reich/dp/067440419X">Hitler’s Justice: The Courts in the Third Reich</a></em> for further information. The bastions of freedom, a government of laws and a free press, were destroyed within the first months of Hitler’s take-over. Concerning the law and its relationship to government, there was a long history in Germany, reaching back at least to post-Napoleonic times, of right-wing nationalism, and a tendency to believe that the state, the government, knows best. States of emergency, that suspended the existing order while the law was suspended, had been introduced during the Weimar republic. Carl Schmitt, the theorist of a state of emergency cited above, wrote in 1922 that during a state of emergency “authority proves that it need not have a basis in law in order to establish justice.”<span class="citation">13</span> By 1934, Schmitt wrote, “The whole of German law today…must be governed solely and exclusively by the spirit of National Socialism.”  At a national convention of jurists in October 1933 in Leipzig, 10,000 lawyers swore, with their right arm raised in the Nazi salute, “by the soul of the German people,” that, “they would strive as German jurists to follow the course of [their] Führer to the end of their days.”<span class="citation">14</span></p>
        
                            <p>Note “the soul of the German people.” The Nazi attack on all the philosophical and political gains made since the American and French revolutions, in other words since the Enlightenment, was based on man’s ability to reason. To a terrifying extent, feeling was exalted above thinking. A law professor wrote in a respected journal in 1933 that it “behooved lawyers to extol the Führer as a figure of light and a hero who is leading the German soul [there it is again…] out of the depths into the light, showing it a safe place to Valhalla,” and on and on. Göbbels, Hitler’s notorious propaganda minister, famously remarked that the task of National Socialism was “to erase the year 1789 from German history.” Hallmark achievements of constitutional government—the subjection of State authority to law, equality of citizens before the law, and certain inviolable individual rights—were done away with, as Nazi ideologists stated that, “the constitutional state [is determined in National Socialism] by a profound idea of legality.”  “In future, decisions should be handed down only by one who lives in his people, feels with his people, and seeks justice where it is born, in the healthy common sense of the people.”<span class="citation">15</span> A new form of law was not to be reached by logical reasoning but was to be “felt...by a member of the <em>Volk</em>.” Basic principles of law were abolished. By June 1935 part of the criminal code was reworded to read that “that person will be punished who commits an act which the law declares to be punishable, or which deserves punishment <em>according to the fundamental principle of a criminal statute or healthy popular opinion”</em> [italics mine].<span class="citation">16</span> Imagine yourself negotiating the kind of minefield that replaces legal prohibitions with “healthy popular opinion.”</p>
        
                            <p>The Grand Criminal Panel of the German Supreme Court, presided over by President Bumke, the older brother of our Munich friend Oswald Bumke, exhorted German judges to recall that “the judiciary…can fulfill the task imposed on it by the Third Reich only if it does not remain glued to the letter of the law, but rather penetrates its innermost spirit.” Since Jewish attorneys had already been excluded from the bar they did not have to participate in this travesty. The <em>Volksgerichtshof</em> [folk law court], established in April 1934, did not have the task of administering justice, but rather of eradicating the enemies of National Socialism. The atmosphere created by a government ruled by such arbitrary deceptions encouraged the worst in its citizens, and helped to spread fear. The historian Fritz Stern writes of “the question that has haunted people for half a century: How was it possible? “…how could so many members of the German elite, so many guardians of the German spirit—pastors and army officers, civil servants and university professors—have found Hitler acceptable or patriotic or idealistic?”<span class="citation">17</span> Stern answers this question by pointing to Hitler’s, “murky mixture of delusion, drama and intrigue,” to how, “by terror and seduction Hitler enthralled the Germans,” how “every speech and every rally was a celebration of passion and unreason.” On the first day of Hitler’s chancellorship a torchlight parade was held, setting the tone for what was to come. “The ominous spectacle demonstrated...the National Socialists’ dazzling command of the pageantry of politics...the eerie show was a signal of invincibility and a threat of intimidation. Many thought [of the new government] as the rebirth or regeneration of Germany.”<span class="citation">18</span> The Nazi party rallies in Nürnberg were an orgy of Wagnerian overtures, martial songs, banners, goose-stepping troops, torchlight processions, bonfires and large firework displays, along with lengthy addresses by Hitler. Hundreds of thousands of the party faithful bellowed their approval.</p>
        
                            <p>The screaming, the intoxication, the parades and the frenzy of admiration for Hitler were anathema to Willi Schmid, and his repugnance for these mindless displays were shared by Kate and us children. We had been taught to admire restraint, to emulate thoughtful reflection. We were to reign in our more immoderate impulses. “Don’t be wild,” I can hear Vati saying. We observed our elders valuing contemplation and silent thought and prayer, not the shouting of mobs. How often had Vati exhorted us to think! <em>“Du musst nachdenken, Dusch,”</em> he would say in his kind, encouraging voice. <em>Nachdenken</em> is an especially appealing word. It literally means “think after,” comparable to “go after.” Go after that thought. We found the lack of self-control of the yelling crowds shocking. To this day, Hedi and I have a horror of screaming crowds. The people we saw wallowing in Nazi rallies, marches and so forth struck us as fundamentally different from us, and we tried to avoid such occasions.</p>
        
                            <p>Our father did not have the privilege of avoiding the Nazis. At the beginning of 1933, Willi had no steady income of any kind. The offer of a job as music critic for Munich’s most prominent paper was in the works, but his decision to take the job must have been agonizing.</p> 
        
                            <p>The <em>MNN</em>, with the largest circulation in Munich and Bavaria, had been known for its sense of responsibility, patriotism (as opposed to the demented nationalism of the Nazis) and participation in the political life of the region and nation. The Nazis considered it a special case because it had long followed a course hostile to National Socialism. Its political line could best be described as national-clerical-Bavarian. After World War I a controlling interest in the <em>“Neueste,”</em> as it was called for short, had been acquired by Rhenish steel interests. The Schmids’ friend Karl Haniel represented the majority stockholders as chairman of the board of Knorr and Hirth, the publishers of the paper.</p>
        
                            <p>During the 1932 political campaign, the board recommended to the MNN administrative and editorial staff that opposition to the Nazis should be more restrained, and sails be trimmed to the new political wind. The staff successfully opposed this pressure. There were a fair number of differing political views among the staff; some were clerically oriented, some Bavarian monarchists. The former editor-in-chief, Fritz Gerlich, had been a fanatical opponent of the Nazis and had left to publish his own paper, <em>Der Gerade Weg</em> (The Straight Path). He had been taken into protective custody by the Nazis on March 9, 1933, and later released. About midnight on June 30, 1934, he was taken to Dachau, and after severe maltreatment was shot.</p>

                            <div id="loadThree"></div>
                             
                            <p>The paper had maintained its anti-Nazi line from 1932 to 1933, until Leo Hausleiter, the SS colonel who had the gall to speak at Willi Schmid’s funeral, was made a trustee and the editor-in-chief, replacing Gerlich in March of 1933. He laid off about fifty employees. Willi Schmid must have been a replacement for a dismissed employee. He needed a job desperately, and the opportunity of becoming the well-paid music critic of a nationally known paper must have looked like a compelling reprieve from a catastrophic financial situation.</p>
        
                            <p>The Schmids’ financial situation was so dire that they had been forced to accept an offer from Alfred and Marguerite Oehler, Swiss friends of long standing, to have Thomi and me spend some months at their beautiful Aarau place, the <em>Blumenhalde</em> [Flower Hill]. That decision cost Willi and Kate great anguish, but in our absence they could rent our rooms to paying guests. How could Willi have refused a job at the <em>MNN</em>? The job was, to begin with, provisional, and that may have helped to make it palatable to Willi. He, along with many Germans, may have thought that Hitler would not last.</p>
        
                            <p>Hitler, however, left no stone unturned to increase his control over the press, which he considered an important instrument of popular education.  On April 30, 1933, he therefore took over the <em>Reichsverein der deutschen Presse</em> (Reich Association of the German Press). The association was given a new constitution that required membership of all working journalists. Everyone, old and new members, was to be checked for “racial and political reliability.” Employment as a journalist was declared a public function, and “the special relationship in which the association stood to the Ministry of Propaganda [headed by Göbbels] made it in fact an agency of coercion and control...the journalists became bondsmen of state and party.”<span class="citation">19</span> Willi must have been among them. All journalistic activity was henceforth under the supervision of the ministry of propaganda, which after the passage of a new Journalists’ Law in October, 1933 could remove a journalist from the occupational list without giving him recourse to appeal.<span class="citation">20</span> Publishers lost all rights to determine content or establish policy for their paper. Editors became the equivalent of state officials.</p>
        
                            <p>On April 25, 1934 questionnaires went out to publishers, followed by personal visits from officials of the Nazi Publishers Association, asking if the publisher had been a former anti-Nazi? Did he change his mind and prove his reform by the conduct of his business? Does he have children to inherit and carry on his business? Are they being brought up as Nazis and do they belong to Nazi organizations? The investigators asking these questions had been instructed to consult the Gestapo and the <em>Kreisleiter</em> (Nazi district leaders) concerning files on the publishers. Anyone who was a “difficult case” received a letter stating that certification of his publishing company was pending, and that he was to specify in what relationship he, his family and his chief employees stood to the Nazi <em>Weltanschauung</em> (ideology), of which Nazi organizations they were members, and if none, why not.</p>      
                            <p>Nazi methods closed down seventy-nine newspapers in Bavaria between 1935 and 1937, the heaviest losses in Germany.  “The only suitable comment…would be that it was a disgrace anywhere the words ‘law and justice’ are understood and respected.”<span class="citation">21</span></p>
        
                            <p>The news of Willi’s provisional job as the Neueste music critic came to us at Aarau through his Benedictine friend, Father Thomas Michels, who conveyed Willi’s doubts and hesitations. A letter dated August 4, 1933 from Marguerite Oehler’s sister, Sophie Schaefer, expresses gladness at this favorable development to the Schmids, adding, “Willi, even if it is hard to suppress conscience and opinion...” Innocently, Sophie goes on to speculate that “there will come a day when Hitler, with all his good will, will be the master.” It may astonish us that the Swiss with free access to the international press were at that early date still so utterly misled by Hitler’s dissimulations and lies. We will see in a later chapter what Willi made of his new job, how he remained true to himself and how his writings embodied timeless values.</p>

                            <p>The climate of fear and repression that the Nazis had inflicted on Germany in the year and a half of their reign that preceded June 30, 1934, explains why it must be considered an achievement that Kate managed to get Willi’s coffin released from Dachau, to have a Catholic funeral for Willi, and to defy the Nazi party by insisting on a proper government pension for herself and for us children. Foreign press reports about Willi’s murder having reached a wide audience within Germany, Kate received a flood of condolence letters from family, friends and strangers. A number of these letters contain reflections on Willi that help to provide a more disinterested view of his personality than I could provide on my own. While it is to be expected that most people writing will only speak good of the dead, the words they chose tell something substantive. The letters also throw light on the circumstances in which people found themselves, and how personally stricken a number of them felt. Both the loss of a beloved friend and the violent manner of his death weighed on the minds of these correspondents.</p>
        
                            <p>I will begin with one letter unique among those Kate saved, an exception to all others. This is the only evidence we have that there was one friend who fell for Hitler’s lies concerning the conspiracy. The writer, whose stationary lists him as Professor Dr. Hermann Hück, was a physician in Karlsruhe. He writes on July 15: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">Dear Kate, two weeks have passed since the terrible event, and it must still be as horrible as ever for you. The fact that I waited till today to approach you with a warm handshake is not a sign that I was not as profoundly shaken as all your other friends. Dorothee [his wife], Traudi and I spoke of nothing else but the events of June 30 for days on end, and the enigmatic involvement of Pitsch [Willi] in this catastrophe. I used the few connections I have in Munich to make inquiries, but to date could not obtain any information that would explain the background of this awful occurrence. I would like to ask a thousand questions but I suspect that you would not be able to answer them. For after the Führer’s last speech [the infamous address to the <em>Reichstag</em> of July 13] I think it questionable that a judicial process can be initiated to identify those responsible for the ‘mistake’. Of course that would not alter your or the children’s fate, but you, like everyone who admired or loved Pitsch, will have a strong desire for expiation. A higher perspective in contemplating those days will, for an outsider, make the significance of a single life unimportant, since Hitler’s unparalleled, strong action saved the life of many thousands. But that is hardly a consolation for you, particularly as the manner of the event was so mercilessly hard for you. Be assured that we are all thinking of you very intensely, even though we cannot help at all.</p>
        
                            <p>The use of the intimate form of address (<em>Du</em>, not <em>Sie</em>), shows Hück to have been a close friend. His sentiment toward Kate seems sincere enough, but he appears to be completely blind concerning the true nature of Hitler’s assault on what had remained of German civil rights. He has nothing to say about Willi’s value as a human being, or the extent of Kate’s loss. His “warm handshake” must have been cold comfort indeed for Kate, but there were many other letters providing her with true support.</p>
        
                            <p>The following family letter is one of the most heartwarming that Kate received, and contains an important and thoughtful reflection on Willi. It came from Oma Hedi’s younger brother, Max Pinner, dated Berlin, August 4. Max turns first to the visit Rudolf Hess has paid to Kate to express official condolences for Willi’s “erroneous” death. Max writes: 
                            </p>
                            <p class="condolences">Although there can be no coming to terms about the event [the murder], and the loss of this beloved, most valuable man cannot be made good through anything in the world, nonetheless it is reassuring and makes one more conciliatory when a person of the highest standing expresses his and the entire government’s sympathy and profound regrets.</p>
        
                            <p>He goes on to mention us children, “those beloved creatures...whom you will bring up to be strong human beings, in accordance with their father’s intentions, which, considering the perfect agreement between you two also conforms with your goals for them.” He continues:</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">We know that Willi was full of faith, and he was the best example that all the achievements of science and technology do not have to take away people’s faith. He could not have performed that glorious music of the past in such consummate fashion had he not had the innermost devoutness. When in earlier, happier days we sought relaxation in Bavaria and the Tyrol, I was partial to visiting Catholic churches, and was deeply impressed by the solemn beauty which one can only value and describe as ‘Catholic beauty’. And Willi’s life was of this Catholic beauty, and not last for that reason did I hold him so dear and value him... . I want you to be certain that all the love I bore your beloved mother from my earliest childhood I will transfer to you. 
                            With a warm embrace, your old faithful Uncle.</p>
        
                            <p>Other friends also spoke of Willi’s rootedness in Catholicism being such an important aspect of his identity. Their friend Traudi Stern writes on July 4: “Pitsch wrote to me after his father’s death, ‘happy are those who have faith, as we do.’” A letter from the poet Karl Wolfskehl [1869–1948] to Father Thomas, from about the same time, states: “The deepest man, the purest soul, the most devout nature, the friend….This world without him, his city without him, his work without him—how poor everything has become. For those left behind there is a father in heaven...[Part of the letter is illegible.] ...yet mercifully carried off. ...I am entreating [heaven] for Kate, may my heart be pure enough to be heard.”</p>
        
                            <p>The principal of Thomi’s and my school, Ernestine Ebermayer, writes on July 5: “Let me say that I received, in the short time I have known you, a most ideal impression of your husband and your family life. You can imagine that my worry and thought concern your children, whom I have come to love with all my heart. Their warm, trusting nature and their very special gifts make them stand out from the ordinary flock of children. It is a blessing that they cannot yet grasp what they have lost in such a father.”</p>
        
                            <p>A younger friend, Ruth Mayer, writes on July 6: “I have some inkling of what it means for you to have lost such a husband. How much I always admired him. He often seemed far away when I was with both of you, for he somehow stood so far above average people...I think of the hours with him bicycling and enjoying nature. And how strong and noble he was in fateful hours.”</p>
        
                            <p>Reinhold Piper of the well-known Piper publishing house wrote, “What your poor husband must have suffered. Please be assured that my wife and I are thinking of you with heartfelt sympathy, and that we will keep fresh the memory of your husband, whom we found so exceedingly congenial both as a man and as an artist.”</p>
        
                            <p>Emmy Oldenbourg, the wife of the publisher of <em>Unvollendete Symphony,</em> the book of Willi’s literary remains that Kate was to edit shortly, wrote on July 8:</p> 
        
                            <p class="condolences">There are events for which one cannot find words, indeed, does not even want to find words. All of Munich is in a state of speechlessness and embitterment over the fate of your husband. A wave of spontaneous compassion is sweeping through the city when people imagine the emotional tortures through which you, dear Frau Schmid, must have gone. Who would have the courage or the strength to say at this point with an honest heart, ‘Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do.’ Like innumerable others I also watch at the grave of this immaculate and universally revered man.</p>
        
                            <p>The tragic loss of Willi was mourned by the secretary general of the German Society for Christian Art, as well as the director for the Bavarian Office for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments. The society had offices in Munich, Vienna, Luxembourg, Belgium and St. Gallen; that is, it was not simply national in its aims.</p>
        
                            <p>A man unknown to me, Hermann Nüssle, writes on July 8: “Your husband whom we hold in such high esteem for his refined, amiable personality…” I have used amiable for the lovely German word, liebenswürdig, which is one of those untranslatable words. The French expression aimable has the exact same meaning. It means “worthy of love,” but it is a blend of likable, charming, easy-mannered, winning and courteous. </p>
        
                            <p>That same day Friedrich and Bertha Seifert, also unknown to me, write: “For us as for untold others this splendid human being and artist is alive. All his harvest, even the last and most difficult, will ripen abundantly. That is what we believe.”</p>
        
                            <p>On July 10 there is a letter from Käthe Bencker, a close friend. She writes: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">‘He gave comfort to us all,’ the Saint Matthew Passion rings out. What could not that surprisingly rich heart pour out, give away! What was Willi for me? A loving and caring brother, a helping, blessed friend, a joyful and paternally patient teacher.</p>
        
                            <p>The same day the Countess Kramer-Klett writes: “How much joy this dear, refined man brought even to strangers with his art. How rich life with him must have been. One trembles before such a hard fate.”</p>
        
                            <p>Willi’s Swiss friend Paul Schaefer writes from Brugg on July 12: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">You know how much I loved Willi. You may have surmised how much I owe him, owe you both… Because you both, so closely joined and complementing each other, you two together were the source of great strengths, which gave rise to such a richly diverse circle of friends...You say yourself that Willi gave you much, but also expected much from you. I am sure he expects one more thing from you, that...you assume his task and duty. It is true that you cannot complete what he would have given his friends and his people in terms of art and perception. But what he wanted to give his children stands before you as a fertile task...What a father he would have been to them! Now that strengths are beginning to stir in them that animated their father, is it not your challenge to transmit as much of Willi’s nature to them as you were able to absorb in your splendid marriage with him? </p>
        
                            <p>Another unknown correspondent, Emma Heydweiller, writes on July 15, “Your husband was for me a personality so prodigiously above the average because of his <em>Liebenswürdigkeit</em> (amiability), his character, and his extensive knowledge.”</p>
                             
                            <p>Carola Lammers, a young woman who stayed with us at the Schackstrasse for some time, wrote on July 18: “I hope you can sense to some extent how all your friends feel that their heart has been choked off.”</p>
        
                            <p>Julia Menz, a harpsichordist whom Willi considered an “ideal” musician and a friend, writes on July 20:</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">I have come to learn by what has been swept away with Willi how blessed and encouraging just the consciousness of his strong and distinguished existence was. I cannot find a consoling word—only—many, many have been hurt along with you and are paying with suffering and sorrow for the riches they shared through him. Please let me know if I can come see you tomorrow. I long once more to breathe in the atmosphere of that world which you both shared, and which was a refuge for my thoughts and a comfort for my heart.</p>
        
                            <p>Hans Graeser, who wrote to Kate on July 21, was the brother of Wolfgang Graeser, a greatly gifted young genius about whom you will hear in a later chapter. The three young men had known each other while Graeser’s father, a Swiss physician, was working and teaching in Munich. Wolfgang committed suicide in 1926. Hans has this to say: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">The way I always thought of Willi was like the man in the fable: I was so certain of owning a treasure that I never had to reach for it. I always felt that this friendship was on such a firm foundation and that it would last, and now all that is gone... . I cannot even think of your state of mind. I always admired Willi because he was alive in such a consummate way, with a harmonious balance that I have only come across among integrated, grounded figures such as one finds among the peasants. In such a distinct intellectual as Willi, the quality is unique.</p>
        
                            <p>A remarkable letter was addressed to Kate by Nina Runge Courant on July 28. (Her husband Hans Courant, for whom the Courant Institute at New York University is named, emigrated to the U.S. in 1934 with his family.)</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">Dear Frau Schmid, Forgive me for intruding; I know nothing about you except that you belonged to a noble human being, that cheerful, equable man who so especially personified the wonderful Germany in which I was privileged to grow up, and which I will now leave. I came to know your husband in the early years of the war here in Göttingen, where he was recuperating in the military hospital. We played music together, and we also played for him. He made a big impression on me because he played both the cello and the violin, and any critique he offered was always essential and constructive… How bitter for you it must be to have lost him in this way. What I can understand least of all is that no one believed him, that none saw that he could not be the one they were seeking. </p>
                            <p class="condolences">[...]I am about to move with my husband, who is Jewish, to New York where he will be a visiting professor at New York University. He also [like Willi] served in the war and was German with his whole heart. Our children are to grow up as free, un-oppressed human beings, and that unfortunately means they cannot be where we have our roots. If ever a time comes when we can do something for you or your children, I would like to do so very much.</p>
        
                            <p>Marguerite Oehler sent a photograph of Willi, taken on April 30 when he was at the Blumenhalde, and writes: “Oh Kate, if we had had any idea last fall of what disasters were threatening you and us we would never have had a cheerful moment. Mercifully the future is hidden.” In the late summer she sent some Alpenrosen, the now protected Alpine rhododendron, to Kate for Willi’s grave, and writes, </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">My thoughts and love come with them… I stopped at a little Catholic chapel. Kate, I couldn’t actually say any definite prayers, but everything I felt for you and Willi flowed together, I don’t know what wishes, what love, what longing and homesickness. And I thought how enviable it is after all for Willi and all of them, that they are now already walking in ‘the radiant expanses,’ while we hardly know what the morrow will bring, and know only that the time that lies before us will be neither rosy nor even tolerably cheerful.</p>
        
                            <p>Kätl Dechansreiter, who wrote to Kate on August 5, was our maid-of-all-work when I was very small, when Thomi was born. She is the one who took me to Josef Kinzl’s studio to have my portrait painted. I am quite certain that Kätl left school at fourteen. Here is her letter: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">The doom that befell your so good, cherished husband, the dear, devoted, caring father of his children, my unforgettable, always helpful Herr Doktor, like a bolt from the blue, is still a mystery to me to this day…I wonder how you are, and your three children, on this cold, alien earth which does not stand still, even without one of its best. You may be certain, dear Frau Doktor, that Herr Doktor will live in my memory and that I will never forget to remember him in my prayers. I am so very sad that I had not seen Herr Doktor for such a long time, when he was always so kind and nice to me—now it is over. I greet you in deepest sympathy and grief.</p>
        
                            <p>The letters continued to come. On August 18, Lotte Vossler, the daughter of Willi’s professor and friend Karl Vossler, wrote from Benediktbeuren, a former Benedictine monastery, </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">He would have liked it here… Every joy that still comes to you originates with him in a better world. You know that he will never forget you, and that such love lasts beyond the grave. His tender, pure soul, that with which he loved you, is immortal, and its strength will surround and bless you every day. If you want to you will always be able to feel it.</p>
        
                            <p>Françoise Delebeque, a French friend who with her brother Eduard had spent the summer of 1931 with us, wrote on August 18, “We, Eduard and I, never knew another husband and wife who suited one another so perfectly.” Her brother wrote on October 31, “And then he introduced me to the charms of his beautiful country, which he loved so much. The traveler, the musician, the scholar, this friend made a complete and perfect man, a man in the noblest sense of the word. I wept for my incomparable friend.”</p>
        
                            <p>Walter Jablonski, Willi’s closest friend, was staying with his mother in Montagnola, in the Ticino. They had both fled Germany. He wrote to Kate:</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">I hope the children are healthy and as full of zest for life as before. With whom does Thomi take his ‘men’s walks’? I cannot easily give consolation...Although I believe myself to be religious I still could not consider that a means of lessening the heavy blow of suffering, or diluting the grief. Nothing remains except the courage to walk into the night if fate demands it, and the certainty that the light continues to shine even if at times it does not shine on us. </p>
        
                            <p>Lia Jablonski, Walter’s mother, adds: “I...am thinking of all the hours that my cherished honorary son spent in my house. These were sunny hours for me, his presence always a source of happiness.” She said she was saving Willi’s last letter to her, written the day before he was killed, “like a sacred relic”.</p>
        
                            <p>The widow of the Bavarian landscape painter Julius Widnmann, whose “Gravel Pit in Bavaria” is the treasured picture over my mantelpiece, writes on September 24: </p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">I want to express my profound gratitude for all the kindness and beauty you and your departed husband brought into the life of my beloved husband. Daily I think of his visits to the studio, his heartfelt empathy with my husband’s artistic aims, his vigorous championing with word and deed.... How many shining hours he brought to my husband’s spirit. Only an artist’s heart like that of your husband can fathom how necessary the appreciation of experts is for someone creative. Willi Schmid did so much for my husband that that also will be repaid to him in eternity...It will remain unforgotten my whole life long. With warmest thoughts and greetings to you and your darling children.</p>
        
                            <p>Mrs. Oldenbourg, the publisher’s wife, sent a second letter to Kate on October 22. “In him I found the deepest kind of humanity, humaneness…How greatly blessed was your life by the side of such a man, and how impoverished you have become now that he is no longer among us.”</p>
        
                            <p>Pablo Casals, whom Willi and Kate had come to know (and admire without end) wrote on September 5:</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">Chère, chère Madame! Oh! How I pity you. I wish I could convey to you my suffering, my pity and my sympathy for you, and my rage at those who removed all your happiness by taking the life of your husband. What precious memories I have of both of you, delicate and profound souls. I consider what you and he gave me a sacred relic, now more than ever. That man whom I felt to be so good, thoughtful [in French he used the word concentrée] and full of ideals for life and for art had to become a victim of the madness of blind villains—what fate!—and what infamy. And now that your country has taken everything from you, what does it propose to do with you? Will one cruelty be followed by another, by leaving you alone to disentangle the course of your life and that of your children? I beg you to let me know as I cannot believe that such a thing is possible. Chère madame, I assure you of my deep distress.</p>
                            <p class="condolences">With profound sympathy,</p> 
                            <p class="condolences signature">Yours Pablo Casals.</p>
        
                            <p>A retired teacher writes on December 20: “I have visited his grave repeatedly. The walk there is a pilgrimage for me...Since July 6, when I heard of his dreadful fate, I have not had a cheerful hour. The thought of his last hour, and your terror, fills me with dread. I pick up the newspapers with disgust... the main section I put aside unread.”</p>
        
                            <p>Hans Graeser also sent another letter: “There was no man whom I held in such unconditional esteem, whom I loved (sounds foolish) as much as Willi, and his unbelievably harmonious self.”</p>
        
                            <p>Oswald Spengler (1880–1936) said his farewell to Willi in a perceptive essay that he wrote as a foreword to the Unvollendete Symphonie. He speaks of Willi as one of the last Catholic lyricists and letter writers:</p>
        
                            <p class="condolences">It is very rare to hear the quiet voice of a late straggler…audible only to a few ears. The great, unsolvable questions don’t press in…but are there, as a matter of course, in a harmonious world, into which they belong like the reflecting clouds of a summer sky…This kind of introspective contemplation, which looks for society or owns it in deepest matter-of-factness, is almost extinct [but] Willi Schmid’s pieces are some of the last, real works.<span class="citation">22</span></p>
        
                            <p>Many letters, not quoted here, praise similar aspects of Willi’s nature, most of all the inner calm that enabled him to spread warmth, comfort and courage to people around him. It was that heart’s ease that we missed most after his death, that unquenchable source of praise and thanksgiving for life. A Benedictine friend of Viki, my second husband, wrote a little book called “Gratefulness, the Heart of Prayer,” and a German theologian once explained to me that being grateful qualifies as faith, or as a religious or at least spiritual virtue. Fraulein Ebermayer may have been right in thinking that we children were too young to know what we had lost, but all three of us knew that we bitterly longed for our father’s grateful heart.</p>
        
                            <p>I have left for last a remembrance of Willi written by his friend and colleague Willi Schuh, published in the <em>Schweizerische Musikzeitung</em> (Swiss Music Journal) no.16/17 of 1934. I value it particularly for its warmth and clarity, and for the high esteem it manifests for Willi’s learning, his seriousness and his insight into the essence of music. It begins with a quote from Hofmannsthal, the Austrian poet who was Richard Strauss’s librettist and a great poet in his own right:</p>
        
                            <div class="letter inset">
        
                            <p class="inset first">In remembering a friend who has died at the height of his</p>
                            <p class="inset">powers the soul hovers as though suspended over a</p>
                            <p class="inset">waterfall. It plunges to the bottom with the living</p>
                            <p class="inset">substance, sees it disperse in the spray and become a haze,</p>
                            <p class="inset last">mounts back up to the top and again plunges, in vain.</p>
                            <p class="inset last">Hugo von Hofmannsthal</p>
        
                            <p>This is not the place to express the feelings of anguish that were induced by the almost unbelievable report that Willi Schmid was one of the innocent victims of June 30 in Munich. Since German publications only briefly mention his ‘accidental death’ it is up to us to sketch the life and influence of this unusual, widely learned German in our publication, whose loyal and respected contributor he was for many years. We can also base the right and honorable duty to remember him on the fact that Schmid, whose artistic and personal connections extended to Austria, Italy, France and Spain, was particularly closely tied to Switzerland, where he and his family frequently stayed with friends. </p>
        
                            <p>I can think of no description that better presents the figure of Willi Schmid as it lives on in memory than what Peter Dörfler said at his friend’s graveside: ‘was he an artist or a scholar? He was both in one, and this oneness was heightened and produced a felicitous impact through pure, profound human virtues stamped with Christian values. He was a son of Munich; if one loves Munich, the best of Munich, one had to love him, for his love of life, his natural ways, the manner in which he was raised in intimate affinity with the arts made him from his earliest youth an example of choicest Bavarian vintage.’ </p>
        
                            <p>Willi Schmid the deep-rooted Bavarian was born in Weilheim in Upper Bavaria, the son of a teacher. He completed the Luitpold-Gymnasium in Munich and began his university studies there with courses in philology and art history under Bäumker, Vossler and Wölfflin. The most influential of his music teachers was Christian Döbereiner, who considered Willi Schmid his appointed successor and the man who would continue his life’s work. As early as his university days Schmid was drawn to Italy. A semester in Rome established his congenial relationship to the country to which he would return over and over, as a musician with the Munich Viol Quintet which he founded, and as an observant, exhilarated traveler, the last time a few weeks before his death. The close relationship he had developed to antiquity, Homer and Plato, and particularly to Virgil and later to St. Augustine and Petrarch, was strengthened and deepened by contact with the people and culture of Italy. Yet Willi Schmid roamed through France and Holland with the same receptivity of heart and spirit.</p>
        
                            <p>The war, whose horrors he suffered on various fronts in all its psychological and physical dimensions, interrupted his studies for years. In Serbia he was felled by typhoid fever, on the Somme he received an abdominal wound which hospitalized him for a year and a half and continued to trouble him as long as he lived. Schmid got his Ph.D. with Bäumker and Alois Fischer with a thesis about Don Bosco’s pedagogical work. At the same time he continued to strive in order to expand his understanding of literature and the fine arts. This effort bore fruit in his numerous essays that dealt with a wide range of themes. His truly comprehensive knowledge and his profoundly artistic turn of mind permitted him on the one hand to analyze Picasso’s etchings on Ovid’s Metamorphoses, on the other hand to illuminate problems of old or new music—for example his review of Hindemith’s oratorio—in a way that revealed his independent judgment. His stint as the art and culture critic of the Allgemeine Rundschau (Universal Review) and the Bayerische Kurier (Bavarian Courier) for years limited the sphere of his influence. In truth, his great and real modesty kept him from pushing himself into the limelight. An inward and deeply religious man, it was essence he cared about, not appearance.</p>
        
                            <p>As a musician Schmid made his most valuable contribution through the founding and intellectual leadership of the Munich Viol Quintet (Härtl, Huber, Stuhlfaut, Köhler, Schmid). His contribution to musical learning as a collector, arranger and player cannot be overestimated. Anyone looking through the programs that the quintet presented at the <em>Münchner Musikwochen</em> (Munich Music Weeks) and in cooperation with Berberich’s <em>Domchor</em> (Cathedral Choir),and particularly also during numerous tours, can measure the extent to which this work enhanced understanding of ancient music and ancient instruments. This group, permeated by an exemplary conception of art, managed to raise enthusiastic echoes as far away as southern Italy. ‘How much faithfulness to art is necessary to achieve something on this level,’ an Italian newspaper wrote about these ‘refined and profound musicians.’</p>
        
                            <p>The music which the viol quintet included in its programs represented a mere fraction of ancient treasures which Schmid had unearthed in the great music libraries of Europe, and then arranged. He was particularly drawn to music of Shakespeare’s time. Choral music he had edited was published in the collection <em>“Heilige Tonkunst”</em> (Sacred Compositions), while music for male choir, also edited by him, was published by Universal Editions.</p>
        
                            <p>It should be mentioned in this connection that Wolfgang Graeser’s friendship with Willi Schmid yielded to that young scholar considerable furtherance with his studies of Bach’s The Art of Fugue. Schmid’s description of Schöck evokes his own nature: ‘close to people, far from people.’ Casals, Edwin Fischer, Paul Hindemith—to name only a few musicians—felt the extraordinary quality, the inner wealth of this man, and became his friends.</p>
        
                            <p>As a musician and as a writer Willi Schmid lovingly and perceptively embraced what is authentic, true and great. Mozart was particularly close to his heart (one of his most beautiful and profound essays concerned ‘The Catholic in Mozart:’ see Schweizerische Musikzeitung, 1931, no. 22) but he also had a great deal of understanding for Verdi. A reflection concerning ‘Wagner and Verdi’ that ends with an interpretation of the two death masks may be considered the most subtle comment that has been made on this theme.</p>
        
                            <p>Schmid had barely a year at a prominent newspaper (the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em>) that allowed his outstanding knowledge and his exceptional gift for descriptive writing to thrive more liberally, more amply—although within the bounds laid down by time and circumstance. His friends had great hopes for the influence of his steadfast, reliable opinions, for the radiating effect of this man of integrity who embodied the best of European culture within himself. Looked at from this point of view Willi Schmid’s death gains a doubly grievous significance.</p>
        
                            <p>Whatever was demanded of his pen on a daily basis, he discharged with the entire commitment of his intellectual power, with a full grasp of a responsibility tremendously expanded by the times. Many an essay from this last year has permanent significance (for example the one on ‘Schopenhauer and Music’) and all of them bear witness to his breadth of view, his natural and sound judgment, the learning and the ethical foundation that marked his being. What tact and what deep insight is evident, for example, in the essays on Richard Strauss’s ‘Arabella’ and ‘Strauss in Dresden’ which he wrote for the <em>MNN</em>, or in the astute study called ‘Richard Strauss and Munich’, which was his last major contribution to the <em>Schweizerische Musikzeitung.</em> The beautifully composed piece that is Schmid’s report on the Schöck festival in Berne, and that shows Schmid’s real affection and profound empathy, constitutes the most important contribution of German music commentary on the subject of Othmar Schöck. </p>
        
                            <p>We had much, maybe the best work to look forward to from the music writer Schmid, who was working on a history of opera in the nineteenth century. Willi Schmid the human being—full of south German heartfelt sensibilities and with a character of unpretentious uprightness and refinement—was a vigorous mainstay and model not only for his family, his wife and three children, but also for his friends. May he be remembered for the purity and goodness of his humanity. We bear witness with Peter Dörfler: ‘He was original and genuine in everything, and therefore certain in his views and firm and straight in his principles. His modest, restrained manner veiled his true quality, and mere show was anathema to him.’ What remains for us is the memory of true manliness in which nature and spirit were harmoniously bound together. We will honor Willi Schmid’s memory by trying to live and work according to his precepts.</p>

                            <p>There were other gestures by friends that were touching. One of the most meaningful concerned the portrait of me at about three years old. Shortly after Thomi was born, I was wheeled, sitting on a special seat attached to the foot end of Thomi’s pram, to visit Herr Kinzl, a friend of Vati’s. Kätl took me, and I wore my best blue dress, quite new and, I thought, beautiful. But what did the painter do? He made me take the blue dress off! Kätl helped me. He wanted to paint me in my slip, which astonished me. We went quite often to the studio, and I learned to sit still. When the painting was done, Herr Kinzl thanked me and kept it. My family told me that he was sending it to Paris, to a competition. And that was the end of it. But after my father died, Herr Kinzl turned up at our house with the painting in both hands, and said to my mother in deepest Bavarian, <em>“Des g’hört jetzt Eahna,”</em> (that belongs to you now). It made my mother very happy.</p>

                            <p>He was of average height and weight, perhaps by our contemporary standards shorter than average, 5’8” or 9”, I estimate. He was a compact, muscular, well-fleshed person with a serious, calm, round face, a reflective, kindly expression in his blue-gray eyes that smiled easily. His movements were usually smooth and rather tranquil, but could become quick and nimble in a flash, as though ordinarily he did not want to intrude on his surroundings with his physical self, but would leap as quick as lightning to prevent some mishap, to steady someone, to assist a child’s faltering motion. His posture while playing the cello or some other instrument was full of attention, very straight but with his body held with a dancer’s supple ease. He was not given to much movement while playing: minimal gestures, maximum concentration on the music. His baritone voice was well-pitched in speech, his enunciation was clear and, among family and fellow Bavarians, inflected with the south German diminutives and idiosyncratic usage of the region.</p>
            
                            <p>I will let Willi’s friend Peter Dörfler (1878–1955), a writer and a priest, describe him: </p>
            
                            <p class="inset">[He was] a man so thoroughly rooted in his native place that he was all the more open to the beauties of other places (Mecklenburg, Italy, Paris)...Latin people in general he held in highest regard. He could give himself over to all beauty, blissful with appreciation and gratitude. He could call himself ‘erotic’ — eros for all God’s creatures, unabashed joy taken in every perfect form. Yet he was so independent of outward things that he might have chosen an ascetic way of life, as a monk or a hermit, but for finding Kate.</p>
            
                            <p>A profoundly contemplative man, Willi used both prayers and thought to achieve the calm his friends treasured, and attain an inward serenity, sometimes hard won, though he was pious at heart. The times were such that they did indeed try men’s souls. In 1926 Willi experienced a really hard time, finding it difficult to write the most conventional assignments. He confessed his troubles to Jablonski, wishing they could see each other more. His way out of his trials was to become a lay member of the Benedictine abbey of Ettal, an associate who was “in the world” but had required obligations. As a consequence Willi read his breviary every day of his life, something from which he drew great strength. </p>
            
                            <p>Before the war he had had dreams of becoming a scholar or a musician, and his many talents made such ambitions appear achievable. The war had robbed him of more than five years. His wounds greatly diminished his physical vigor. Having completed barely two semesters of study, he faced a long road ahead. The harsh reality was that the extended preparation for either a scholarly or a musical career was a luxury he could not afford. Post-war conditions, the hunger and cold, the political upheaval, his own physical condition, uncertainties on every hand made any goal he could conceive of seem far distant.</p>
            
                            <p>In the fall of 1918 and for part of 1919 he still seemed headed for a career as a practicing musician. He practiced and rehearsed a wide range of chamber pieces with his friends, among them Max Schöpper, a violinist, Fritz Seiler, a pianist, and Trude Hirsch, an outstanding violinist. By 1919 the group in various configurations presented concerts in the provincial towns of the Allgäu, with satisfying success. A reviewer in Kempten speaks of the “childishly gay” Mozart piece the trio played, which phrase Willi repeats to Kate in disgust, saying, “What do they know! They haven’t the faintest idea!” His passion for music comes through in his letter to Kate: Bruckner, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Reger—all rapturously described. In September 1919 he reports to Kate that he has bought “a little, old viola da gamba.” (This is the Barak Norman that is now in the Isham Collection at Harvard.) “It cost 300 Marks but will probably cost 200 Marks more for repairs.” But with it he will be able to play old music, especially Bach, properly. He happily tells her that the gamba’s sweet tone makes it particularly suited to chamber music.</p>
            
                            <p>These joyous forays into music were to be pushed into the background by Willi’s somewhat sudden decision, made in late 1919, to become a teacher. He was so deeply in love with Kate that he could not bear to think of putting marriage off much longer. To Kate he speaks of “the heavy burden of fate, which we must oppose,” and speaks to himself as well, saying, “We must find the courage to be ourselves, surmounting all obstacles.” Willi’s chief goal for now was to get married. At the age of twenty-six, he knew that in Kate he had found his life’s partner. Over and over his letters to her speak of the necessity of getting married, of being unable to bear their separation; “over and over again I want you, want to unite the two of us.”<span class="citation">23</span></p>
            
                            <p>In order to live together, they had to marry. Neither their financial status nor their bourgeois families empowered them to consider a bohemian life-style. But those were not the chief reasons for foregoing living together. Willi believed deeply in marriage as a sacrament, and he strove with all his being to enter into that sacrament with Kate. There were other, purely exterior impediments to coming together outside marriage in a society as closely controlled as the Germany of the time. Kate needed official permission to move to Munich. They both needed permission from the housing office to be assigned an apartment. German teachers were civil servants; Willi needed to notify the Ministry of Education of his marital status in order to have his pension, health insurance, etc., cover Kate. Becoming a teacher was the shortest route to becoming a wage earner—in October 1920 he speaks of his “fury at my inability to earn a living”—so teaching is what he chooses.</p>
            
                            <p>This change of career was a bitter pill, but only to his friend Walter Jablonski does Willi confess how bitter it was. To Kate and his family he presented it as the only rational decision, a given. His natural optimism soon came to the fore again, and he told Jablonski that he was surprised how much he enjoyed his pedagogic studies and, afterwards, his contact with the children. In writing Kate on September 11, 1919, after having observed an “outstanding teacher” in a first-grade classroom, he comments that it was a “happy experience and I understand what might make one want to be a teacher.”</p>
            
                            <p>It was obvious to Willi and Kate that a beginning teacher’s salary would not be adequate even for the basics, and he assures Kate that he will always be able to bring in extra money with music lessons, or gigs with various orchestras and chamber groups. Yet his assurances to her that they will be able to get by are accompanied by a determination to set aside time for “a daily measure of work which I want to safeguard to advance [his] deepest interests in addition to [his] ‘profession’”—note the citing of “profession” in quotation marks. He also assures Kate that he needs a complete Plato in Greek and German, which will cost 600 Marks, more than one-third of his yearly salary!<span class="citation">24</span> and, that they must establish a fund immediately for travel.<span class="citation">25</span> He reflects on the misfortune of having been “placed, of all things, in this barbarian, disjointed, un-restful time,” and regrets that he cannot bring about a life, “in the great, free world,” for Kate. But he is confident that they will take refuge “in the high spiritual regions,” through their imagination.<span class="citation">26</span> Sometimes, on the other hand, he regrets not being a black marketeer, since he is horribly greedy for books and would give his life for pictures and books.</p>
            
                            <p>After completing an accelerated teacher-training course for veterans in 1920, Willi was assigned to Blaichach as an assistant teacher, on probation. He writes to Jablonski in April, “I have been teaching six-to seven-year-old boys for a month and a half, introducing them to the secrets of reading and writing, and their first, modest attempts at thinking, which is both a lot of trouble and, more often than I first expected, a joy.” But life in Aichach, a small town northwest of Augsburg, reaffirmed Willi’s determination to teach in Munich as “the provinces are out of the question”. A Munich position, however, was hard to come by, although in the fall of 1920 he got a job in Allach, a town within the administrative district of Munich, but still a bit of a haul from the center.</p>
            
                            <p>During all this time, 1919-20, he attended Munich’s Ludwig-Maximilian University, and in 1920-21 added classes at the Academy of Music on opera and the study of instruments. His first semester at Munich had begun on October 17, 1913. It must have been a proud day for his parents. The percentage of university students in Germany at the time represented a tiny proportion, about ½ percent, of the population. There was a long history of educational discrimination. In 1885, a few years before Willi was born, there were about 7.5 million pupils in primary school, 238,000 were in secondary school, such as teacher training courses and Realschulen which trained workers for industrial and commercial jobs, while only 128,000 children were in the Gymnasien. Preparing for the Abitur, the feared final exam comparable to the French baccalaurate, entitled gymnasium students to attend any university in Germany. The historian Fritz Ringer writes, “as late as the 1920s, [the primary school teachers] were painfully aware of unwritten laws which forbade them to move in social circles frequented by secondary school faculty.”27 It must have cost Willi something to take his degree in teacher training. </p>
            
                            <p>A formal photograph of Willi taken in 1913 shows a self-confident, alert young man. His calling card lists him as a student of modern languages, and is imprinted “Munich and Rome,” for he was planning to spend the spring semester in Rome. Willi’s Bildung, that all-important German education and the holding-sacred-the-works-of-great-thinkers-and-artists that that implied, enabled him to move comfortably in intellectual circles. He had inherited restraint and refined instincts from the Brunhübners, and affability and ease from his father, Pipsi. He was courteous and well-spoken, an excellent musician, and filled with passionate enthusiasm for learning. Various professorial families welcomed him warmly—the Sulgers in Nymphenburg, Professor Curtius in Munich—and when he reached Rome in the spring of 1914, he had an introduction to the archaeologist Walter Amelung who encouraged Willi’s interest in art history. What could have been more wonderful to experience for a youth of Willi’s inclinations and aptitudes than a spring in pre-war Rome? He walked and looked, drank in the beauty of the landscape and architecture, experienced Rome as the glorious ruin of the Roman Empire and the heart of Christianity. He was quite transported by what he saw, he fell half in love with a young woman named Marlies Wild, and he made a life-long friend, Walter Jablonski. </p>
            
                            <p>He writes on March 26, 1914, to Marianne Grossman, his sponsor, that the thought of the coming months fills him with indescribable joy: “Yesterday I spent three hours on the Gianicolo, just looking and enjoying.” His courses at the University of Rome included neo-Latin literature and Italian literature. </p>
            
                            <p>Before continuing the story of Willi’s education and his war service, I want to describe my father’s background more thoroughly. When Willi was born in Weilheim, a walled town about 30 miles southwest of Munich, almost exactly a year had gone by since his parents married. His father, Josef, called Pipsi by his children, was a teacher at a local boys’ school. He came from Buchloe, which lies in the Swabian part of Bavaria, about 35 miles straight west of Munich, near Landsberg am Lech. It was a center of Christian life as early as the sixth century. The dialect spoken there is a softer Bavarian with the nice diminutive endings of Swabia. Josef’s father Karl had been a locksmith, a <em>Kunstschlosser,</em> (a skilled, “artistic” locksmith), hailing from Lower Bavaria. Such locksmiths had to construct complex locks and fix them; Yale locks were just being introduced from America. (Locksmiths may also have made the wonderful wrought iron crosses found in Bavarian cemeteries.) Karl Schmid died at 34, when Josef was four, leaving his wife Barbara and the little boy apparently penniless.</p>
            
                            <p>Pipsi used to boast to his grandchildren, much to the disapprobation of all female relatives, that he was a love child, that his parents had not married until after he was conceived. “They loved each other so much they couldn’t wait,” was his, to us, mysterious explanation. Couldn’t wait for what, we wondered, but Oma Reta’s pinched mouth and look of real distress put a stop to our potential questions. </p>
            
                            <p>The widowed Babette Schmid had no way of supporting her son. She therefore put him in an orphanage run by nuns, and went to work as a cook in a “great house” in Munich. The four-year-old rebelled fiercely against separation from his mother and, according to family lore, was a handful for the nuns. One day he took it into his head to escape the hated orphanage, and again according to a family story, walked to the “great house” where his mother cooked. The poor woman must have been in a terrible bind: she could not keep the boy with her and yet knew that he was miserable in the orphanage. Back he went. It is difficult even to begin to imagine life in a Bavarian orphanage in 1868, but one can pretty much assume that it must have been hard on a born non-conformist like little Josef.</p>
            
                            <p>The nuns apprenticed him to a barber, I believe when he was about 10. At least that allowed him to be outside quite a bit of the time. In those days barbers not only shaved people and cut their hair, going from customer to customer, but performed certain medical procedures. Josef helped carry the barber’s equipment, which included a jar of leeches for bleeding patients. (Itinerant barber-surgeons have figured importantly in the history of medicine, and it had only been about a century since, for example, the law separated barbers form surgeons. The New York Times of June 24, 2004, cites that the Food and Drug Administration approved an application from a French firm to market leeches as a tool for medicinal purposes.) Josef found an effective way of terrifying bullies who bothered him: he threatened to set his leeches on them, and that usually meant they would leave him alone.</p>
            
                            <p>An apprentice barber was of course expected to become a barber, and to finish schooling at the age of 14. Josef was rescued from this fate through the intervention of an anonymous nun. That kind woman took a personal interest in the bright and feisty boy, and made it possible to continue his schooling through a Normal School for future teachers. Since Josef had been a Lausbub, as a rascal is called in Southern Germany, he knew better than anyone how to deal with the Lausbuben that populated his classes, and became a successful and much loved teacher, who soon was promoted to Oberlehrer. In that minutely classified society a Head Teacher was clearly someone who had taken a step up the ladder. Josef ended his teaching career as the director, or headmaster, of the Riemerschmid Schule in Munich, a vocational school for girls.</p>
            
                            <p>Josef Schmid married Margarethe Brunhübner, and thereby hangs another tale. I do not know how the two met, but Josef was in his late twenties and presumably teaching somewhere near Rothenburg. The Brunhübner family lived in Detwang, a village nestled in the valley of the Tauber below Rothenburg. This famous medieval town had been a Freie Reichsstadt, somewhat less subject than many German towns to the whims of German princes. Its town council had had some say in city government for 500 years. Its people were descended from the ancient Franks. In fact, Willi perfectly represented the three tribes that primarily populated Bavaria: the Franks, the Bavarians and the Swabians. The earliest inhabitants were the Celts, who in the last decade before the Common Era were being squeezed between the Teutons to the north and the Romans to the south. The Romans fortified their northern border against the Teutons and the Celts decided to go west. In the 5th century the Germans threw out the Romans, and the remaining populace mixed with the Celts and Romans that remained. The Baiovarii, coming from the east, settled in southern Bavaria between 485 and 520 A.D. In the seventh and eighth century English, Irish and Scottish monks arrived as missionaries to Christianize the area. About the year 800, Charlemagne, a Frank, incorporated Bavaria into his empire, and in 1180 Bavaria became part of the Holy Roman Empire. At that time the Emperor Barbarossa made Otto of Wittelsbach Duke of Bavaria. The Wittelsbachs ruled Bavaria as dukes and, after 1805, as kings until the end of World War I, when King Ludwig III was replaced by the Räterepublik, a republic of councils. </p>
            
                            <p>The Bavarians in the southeast and the Bavarian Swabians, descended from the Suevi, were builders of cluster villages or one-street villages. Their houses sheltered their animals in barns connected to the human dwellings. Agriculture dominated Bavarian economic life. As late as 1925, two and a half million people depended primarily on agriculture for a living. Industrial development lagged behind the German average, with 33.6 percent employed in industry and crafts, but most of these in small or middling concerns. At present Bavaria is the largest Land in Germany, its area a little more than 27,000 square miles, and its population is about 12 million.</p>
            
                            <p>Catholicism is deeply ingrained in Bavaria, with many bishoprics. Second in prominence, but only about a third the number of Catholics, are the Evangelical Lutherans. That is the minority the Brunhübners belonged to. Willi’s grandfather, the only ancestor of that generation of whom we know more than the most elementary facts, was born during the reign of King Ludwig I, the king who gave Munich its contemporary face. This Wilhelm Brunhübner (1842–1900) was a posthumous child; his father died six months before he was born. His mother raised the boy by herself. Unlike Babette Schmid (Pipsi’s mother), she appears to have had some resources as she was able eventually to send her son to the Normal School in Ansbach. A partial diary from 1860, detailing some of Wilhelm Brunhübner’s student days, has survived. He seems to have been a well-intentioned young man and a loving, considerate son. He was not a puritan; references to cigars, beer and pretty young women appear quite frequently in his entries. But he accounted for every penny of his small allowance and was certainly a good boy.</p>
            
                            <p>He became the schoolmaster of Detwang, and lived in the teacher’s quarters that the town provided. This commodious, <em>gemütlich</em> house still stands opposite the church of Saints Peter and Paul. The church was consecrated in 968, and is one of the oldest churches in Franconia, with all the dignity and simplicity of its Romanesque style. It also has a well-known altar by Tilman Riemenschneider (1460–1531), one of Europe’s most famous Gothic sculptor-carvers. Wilhelm Brunhübner was the organist at the church, a function required of a Bavarian schoolmaster at the time. </p>
            
                            <p>As has been mentioned, the Brunhübners were Protestant, and the family’s roots in Rothenburg, of which Detwang is a part, go back to Georg Christoph Zahn who was the Rothenburg town musician around 1700. Such musicians were responsible for two daily appearances in the town square with their group of brasses and singers. His sons Georg Heinrich and Georg Philip became <em>kaiserliche Hofmusiker,</em> imperial court musicians, in St. Petersburg during the reign of Catherine the Great, a former German princess who ruled Russia from 1762–1796. Georg Philip, whose instrument was the bassoon with which “he used to bring tears and joys to susceptible hearts,” retired to a nearby village, and was killed by a careless hunter. A marker on his grave memorializes him:</p>
            
                            <p class="inset">What help is all your fame, your riches, art and honor</p>
                            <p class="inset">The ill-luck of a shot has brought you down.</p>
                            <p class="inset last">[Quoted from a printed pamphlet.]</p>
            
                            <p>Another bit of evidence attesting to the Brunhübner’s interest in music and their residence in Rothenburg was noted by my cousin Irmi. The keystone of a house in Rothenburg’s Alte Graben (the old moat) bore the date 1793 and the legend, “Johann Friedrich Brunhübner, Musikalischer Saitenfabrikant,” a maker of musical strings.</p>
            
                            <p>Wilhelm Brunhübner married Maria Barbara Raab, probably in the early 1870s. Judging from a photograph of Maria Barbara as a grandmother, she must have been a handsome, perky girl. Their three children were close in age and remembered their childhood as happy, though of course as the schoolmaster’s children they were under some pressure to behave. Judging from Wilhelm Brunhübner’s diary from 1859, when he was a student at the Normal School, he had an impressionable nature and a warm heart. His warm heart is also evident in the surviving letter from 1893 written by him to his newborn grandson and namesake Willi.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta Brunhübner’s marriage to Josef Schmid on April 20, 1892, may not have been entirely her father’s idea of the perfect match. After all, Josef was a Catholic! Reta was strong-minded, though. She had already proved it as an adolescent when she was determined to wear a bustle, a fashionable must in the late 1880s. She had disobeyed her father’s injunction against such frippery by hiding the bustle in a hollow fence-post before coming into the house, and retrieving it on going out, when she needed to wear it to appear properly outfitted in her friends’ eyes. I heard that story from a direct witness, Reta’s sister Babette, our Tanti. We don’t know what Maria Barbara thought of her stubborn daughter, but we do know that after her husband’s death in 1900, when Willi was seven, Maria Barbara went to live with Reta and Josef and their children for the rest of her days. </p>
            
                            <p>It is interesting to speculate whether hesitation about the Schmids’ “mixed marriage,” as a marriage between Catholics and Protestants was judged well into the 20th century, was a factor in Josef’s case. His mother died on March 22, 1892, and he married Reta on April 20, less than a month later. Could it be that he did not want to offend his mother’s sensibilities while she was alive? On the other hand the reason may have been purely economic. His salary might not have permitted support of both a mother and a wife.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta adored her husband; he was a prince in her eyes. Her nervousness and her many anxieties could not have made her particularly easy to live with, but she had a kind and loving heart—and was a marvelous cook, something that Josef cared about a lot. The Schmids never attained more than a modest prosperity in their forty years of marriage, but they had a contented life. There was enough money for good food, instruments, and music lessons for the children, for outings and vacations in the country, where the family stayed with farmers who rented out rooms. Josef and Reta never owned a house, though at one point they bought land in Bayrisch Gmain near the Austrian border with dreams of building a cottage there some day. That day never came: the land had to be sold after World War II because it was too close to the border ever to be built on.</p>
            
                            <p>The lack of affluence neither cramped the Schmids’ style nor kept them from being grateful to the good Lord for His blessings. They lived together for forty-one years, and until the first war led a bourgeois, peaceful life in the center of Munich. “It was an age when life had a widely accepted, predictable character: there was little discord between family and society; the precepts of decorum, and culture were known and generally observed.”<span class="citation">28</span> As my cousin Walter Ringler once put it, eloquently though not elegantly, “The Schmids were able, in the shittiest time in history, to make a peaceful, bourgeois life for themselves.”</p>
            
                            <p>Bavaria was less rigidly divided by class than other parts of Germany. While known for being predominantly conservative, its population had a stubborn sense of entitlement, a sort of “every man a king.” That was especially true of the land-owning peasant farmers, as it is everywhere. A well-known Bavarian saying, <em>Wer ko, der ko,</em> which in high German would read <em>Wer kann, der kann,</em> literally “one who can, can” originated with a certain Franz Xaver Krenkl, a livery owner and horse lover who once ostentatiously overtook King Ludwig I. They were driving along a road, and Krenkl cheerily and cheekily overtook the king, yelling back over his shoulder, <em>Wer ko, der ko.</em> The king may not have been charmed but he let it pass. He was actually quite proud of the fact that ‘his Bavarians,’ as he always called them, were no flunkies.</p>
            
                            <p>This relative freedom from class-consciousness was characteristic of Josef, but not so much of Reta and her sister. Our grandmother and great-aunt were acutely aware of the social order. Reta seems to me in retrospect to have been torn between pride in her origins and worry about manners, style etc., all the baggage of the socially unsure. Her perpetual anxiety and lack of humor must not always have been easy for her husband, a charmer if ever there was one and a man very much at ease with himself. And of course that was just what Reta loved so much about him, what made her eyes shine with admiration when he delivered one of his typical sayings. He enjoyed shocking his listeners a little bit, he never completely shook off his <em>Lausbuben</em> inclinations.</p>
            
                            <p>Kate told me of a time when Pipsi invited her, “because you understand such things, Kätl,” to accompany him to a village nearby where he had a friend, eine Bekanntschaft. He brought his zither along and he and the friend, who turned out to be the innkeeper’s wife, spent an hour or two singing duets to their heart’s content. My mother never mentioned this to Reta—she did understand such things. I myself heard Opsi sing duets to the zither with Oma Hedi, my elegant Mecklenburg grandmother. They clearly had a fine time, but I noticed the pained expression of jealousy on Reta’s face. One could see that she wished she could sing like that.</p>
            
                            <p>Pipsi’s joy in the world was palpable. He welcomed its beauties wholeheartedly, and its vagaries and drawbacks never seemed to get him down. Serious troubles were “offered up” in devout Catholic fashion. He looked sturdy, confident, smiley, a man to lean on. The fact that he suffered from high blood pressure was carefully minimized by twinkling jokes about Onkel Hans’s, his brother-in-law’s, medical concerns. Oh, those Brunhübners, they had to have something to worry about day in day out. He, Pipsi, on the other hand would stick to the teachings of Father Kneipp, a priest from the Allgäu who advocated the healing powers of cold water. In summer, Pipsi encouraged, and practiced, walking barefoot in meadows wet with dew: good for you, he said. </p>
            
                            <p>To this day there are enclosed basins and water-filled hollowed-out logs marked “Kneipp-Installation” in the Isartal, intended to encourage walkers to refresh their feet and arms à la Kneipp. “Walk in stork-like fashion lifting your feet high,” the sign advises. Pipsi would have been delighted.</p>
            
                            <p>Remembering some of Pipsi’s pronouncements reminds me to stress his aversion to vulgarity. His speech was earthy but it was not lewd. There were no knowing looks; there was no sniggering. Serious swearing was in the same category as smutty stories, not within the realm of the possible. There certainly was an occasional <em>Sakra!</em> (holy, i.e. by all that’s holy) or a <em>Jössas!</em> (a Bavarian and thus milder variant of Jesus), but no real cursing. Humor was preferred to sarcasm, making a joke of something deflected anger. That held for Opsi, Vati and the uncles. Uncle Walter sent me a little poem for my first birthday which ends with the advice,</p>
            
                            <p class="inset"><em>Und wenn’s dich ärgern,</em></p>
                            <p class="inset last"><em>Lach’!</em></p>
                            <p class="inset">And when they vex you,</p>
                            <p class="inset last">Laugh!</p>
            
                            <p>Bavarian folkways are known for being bawdy, but that did not repel Pipsi as prurience did. For example, the text under a Marterl could be coarse. These were the wayside markers that invite the passer-by to reflection and perhaps a little prayer, often marking the scene of an accident. One that Pipsi showed us depicted Abraham placing Isaac just above a smoldering fire. The verse says: </p>
                                                
                            <p class="inset"><em>Oh Abraham, es ist umsunst</em></p>
                            <p class="inset"><em>Dieweil der Teufel </em></p>
                            <p class="inset last"><em>in das Zündloch brunst.</em></p>
                            <p class="inset">Oh Abraham, it is in vain</p>
                            <p class="inset">The devil’s pissing</p>
                            <p class="inset last">in the fire.</p>
            
                            <p>The devil of course is shown doing just that. Pipsi told us the story and emphasized that the dear Lord would never ask a father to sacrifice his own child. He wanted to test Abraham, that was all. Oma Reta approved of the Bible lesson, but her more Puritan than Bavarian self recoiled at the frankness of language and illustration.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta kept a bottle of valerian for calming her nervousness, and used other herb-based medicines as well. She also sometimes used toilet water on a handkerchief to wipe her brow. When the Schmids still lived in the Baaderstrasse, they used to have a large tomcat named Bunbury, altered to Bemberi, easier for Bavarian tongues. He was a nice enough cat but a drunk. What he preferred was Reta’s 4711 toilet water. If someone forgot to close the grandparents’ door, Bemberi would streak onto Reta’s bureau, knock over the bottle and guzzle his favorite stuff, then lope off for a snooze. He was the terror of the neighborhood and courted and won numberless fetching young cats. Pipsi used to comment on the convenience of having a roaring brook in the back of the garden, “so easy to drown all those litters of kittens that way,” he said, to our horror and consternation. We never did see him drown even one kitten, and Bemberi spent his evenings on Pipsi’s lap, but you never knew. One of his other conveniences, he said, was that in winter you could save on handkerchiefs. You just waited till any little drop from your nose froze into an icicle, and then knocked it off. No wiping necessary. We longed, alas in vain, to observe that feat.</p>
            
                            <p>Pipsi was very fond of children. He had been a teacher for more than forty years. His warm hands holding ours on a walk, his hugs that smelled faintly of tobacco and sun, his kisses that tickled from his mustache, his singing, zither playing, his laughter: he was perfect in our eyes. When, as a little child of two and a half, I came to the Schlosser farm where the grandparents were staying, he made it acceptable for me to observe how cows defecated, something which at that point I found interesting. While Oma Reta wanted to remove me from the barn as quickly as possible, to shield me from such a shocking spectacle, Pipsi got me a milking stool so I could sit down to observe in comfort. He said, “Let her watch as much as she wants. When she’s seen enough she will come in,” which is just what happened.</p>
            
                            <p>Neither ‘peasant’ nor ‘farmer’ is a proper translation of Bauer. ‘Farmer’ has too many overtones of independence, ‘peasant’ implies too much ignorance and dependence. Most Bavarian Bauern were deeply attached to their land and their village. The hard times from World War I through the Depression had required brutally hard work. Some were able to hold their own, as the Schlossers were with the help of summer visitors like my grandparents. The Berghammers on the Hoinerhof, hard as they struggled, got a little poorer each year. By the time we knew them they had only one cow left. Herr Berghammer had, in lieu of pay, given some of his land to his farmhand. His children, Resi and Anderl, were hard workers but the farm did not prosper. Anderl, who had been in the war with Vati, came home after more than a year in the hospital, with one leg shorter than the other. Did that handicap add to their troubles? Tourists rented rooms at the Hoinerhof, but the primitive facilities (no running water, an outhouse) did not attract an affluent clientele. Even my grandparents had forsaken the Hoinerhof for Aschau, mostly because their son Walter was a teacher in Aschau. Only Vati held the Hoinerhof in highest esteem, loved it above all else.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta loved her children even more passionately than Pipsi did. At one point during the war, Reta woke in the middle of the night, and sitting bolt upright in bed informed Pipsi that she had to go to the main railroad station right away, because she “knew” that Willi was coming through Munich that night. Pipsi said nonsense, if there was a troop transfer under way it would have been in the paper. But Reta insisted, and after searching up and down the platforms looking for Willi’s unit, she indeed found Willi, who had been detached to a different front. A miracle! This established Reta’s reputation as someone with second sight. A further example of her unusual powers was her discovery of a viol for Willi. She recognized a neglected instrument in a pawnshop, and with funds squeezed from the household money, unbeknownst to Pipsi, acquired it in installments.</p> 	
            
                            <p>Reta was an indefatigable housewife, showing her love by constant activity, trying to outdo herself from day to day. It was almost impossible to persuade her to sit down to meals. Even when there was what the Schmids called a “donna,” a helper, in the kitchen, Reta anticipated disaster if she did not supervise every aspect of every household function. Her anxiety made her an easy butt for teasing by her husband and children, sometimes exceeding the bounds of good nature. One Christmas, for example, the roasted goose, ready for dinner after midnight mass, was resting in the pantry. While we were talking, Pipsi disappeared for an unreasonable amount of time, and Reta sent Willi to look for him. Willi similarly disappeared, so his brother Walter was sent to look for them, and also did not come back. When Reta herself went after them she discovered the three wretches in the pantry, removing slivers of meat from the goose breast and trying to hide the evidence of their misdeeds by puffing out the skin with bits of stuffing. (Pipsi was the carver and must have supposed he could cover the crime inconspicuously at the table). That was one time the teasing went too far, poor Reta cried bitterly. Only some music saved that Christmas from being too severely dampened by her tears.</p>
            
                            <p>There is a second, cheerier goose story. It must have been Christmas 1932, during the worst economic times. Uncle Walter was a teacher in Aschau, near the Chiemsee. Money was in short supply for him and Toni and their two boys. Pipsi found an excuse to go see them, and with him brought a nice fat Christmas goose he had bought at the Viktualienmarkt. “No need to mention this to Memmis,” he told them, and took the train back to Munich. The next morning the mailman rang the young Schmids’ bell. “I have a big package from Munich for you,” he said. It was, what else, a second goose, fully roasted by Reta, with a note that said, underlined in red, “Don’t tell Father.” Each had acted irresponsibly in light of the financial realities. Each had been absolutely right according to the heart.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta’s loving concern was not limited to her family. I clearly remember carrying bowls and baskets with dinner to a number of impoverished neighbors of the Schmids, poor old ladies who lived in attic apartments, freezing and starving in those terrible years. My grandmother would exhort me to be on my best, most polite behavior. I was to tell the ladies that once again my Grandmother had foolishly miscalculated the amount of food the family could eat, and here were these leftovers that it would be a sin to waste, and wouldn’t they please help out by eating up the food? I recall climbing the stairs in those strange houses, carefully holding on to the food so I wouldn’t drop it. I was a little bit nervous. Thoughts of Little Red Riding Hood fleetingly came to me—was it safe to ring a strange old lady’s bell? Then I remembered the story of <em>La Bohème</em>. A sick, hungry artist in the attic! My ladies were more apt to be seamstresses or former nursemaids, but at any rate pity overcame funk and I rang the bell. After one of these excursions I must have said something to Oma Reta about my qualms. That is when I saw her at her best. She sat me down with tea and cookies, nourishment always being her first response to any kind of alarm, and very lovingly and with uncharacteristic confidence assured me that the dear Lord specially protected someone on an errand of mercy. Here she felt herself to be on unchallengeable footing—and this was the same grandmother who often seemed so uncertain, so uncomfortable when left in charge of Thomi and me. Here was another puzzle of human conduct for me to ponder.</p>
            
                            <p>Whenever I came up against a complexity of grown-up behavior that gave me pause, I was reassured by one steadying reflection. I could count on my grown-ups’ reliability. My grown-ups were trustworthy. If I was puzzled, that had to be for reasons of limited comprehension. I could take for granted, I could be utterly certain of the current of loving goodwill directed towards us children by our parents, our grandparents and our uncles and aunts.</p>
            
                            <p>Along with his parents, Willi’s childhood included three additional significant personages: his maternal grandmother, Maria Barbara, her daughter Babette, known as Bettli or simply Tanti, and his uncle Hans. Willi reminisces about his Franconian grandmother who lived with his family after her husband’s death. In a letter to Kate from the Hoinerhof he tells Kate that his grandmother had a soft spot for him and would sneak special treats to him. He learned the love of nature from her as well as from his father. Flowers particularly were a matter of importance in the family. Their names were known and taught to us children, as were the virtues of many herbs. The Brunhübners had had a garden in Detwang, so Willi’s grandmother was a source of intimate knowledge of plants for him. Their joint long stays at the Hoinerhof each summer of his childhood reinforced the close relationship to nature. Willi experienced Maria Barbara’s death in 1910 as the first profound disruption of his serene childhood, in some sense the end of his childhood. He mourned her greatly.</p>
            
                            <p>But there was consolation to be found in his violin-playing on one hand, and reading on the other. “From my 12th year on,” he writes to Kate in August 1919, “Stifter, Eichendorff and Mörike have been the chief sources for nourishing my soul.” Reading them in the Hoinerhof hayloft was the best aspect of his childhood. He loves Stifter’s language particularly, “the apotheosis of Bavarian expression,” and affectionately defends Stifter against philistinism.29 He read copiously with special devotion to such German romantics as the ones listed above and also Gottfried Keller. </p>
            
                            <p>The Schmids had moved from Weilheim to Munich in 1897, and after a few years in public school, Willi had taken the admission exam for the Luitpold Gymnasium which he attended from 1905 to 1912. He might have been the first in his family to attend a Humanistisches Gymnasium, the crown jewel of German secondary education, as explained above, though Onkel Hans may have preceded him. At such a gymnasium children learned Latin and Greek, modern languages, literature and history, though not much math and less science. The boys were carefully taught to strive for higher things. The whole tenor of the Luitpold Gymnasium, under its stern principal, Herr Orterer, was aimed toward achieving the ancient humanistic virtues. The boys were to be manly, modest, pure, noble and good, as well as proficient in the subjects that were siphoned into their brains for eight years. Passing the final exam automatically entitled a boy to enter any German university. Willi’s grades were excellent in all but math and science, and his diligence (one got marks for effort all eight years) was exemplary. He found school a bit boring but no real hardship.</p>
            
                            <p>As the valedictorian of his class Willi was, so to speak, a shining specimen of what his preceptors valued, but he was no striver. His presentation at the graduation ceremonies was, in addition to the required address in Latin, a Richard Strauss cello sonata, certainly chosen to show off his prowess on his instrument, but not a piece that catered to the taste of the authorities. Admission to the gymnasium was by examination, and there were fees. It is perhaps comparable to Boston Latin School. The teachers were called Herr Professor, and the rules were strict. Willi as the son of a teacher, and of a mother who placed a premium on virtuous behavior, was no doubt a fairly conforming, discreet student. I imagine him reticent with his private thoughts and convictions, except with close friends. His great love of music and his dreams of becoming an artist he surely kept private. In his 1912 diary he is critical of a friend who reveals his high self-regard to Willi: “I would wish him a little more easy-going ways, more casualness and always also pride (the good kind) which, however must by no means be expressed openly.” And like many another teenager he felt himself to be among “Philistines.” </p>
            
                            <p>The photographs of Willi as a boy show an open, calm face with a gentle expression and a relaxed posture. In his letters to Kate Willi speaks repeatedly of his horror of mobs, his distaste of crowds. That must have been deep-rooted in him. He loved the solitude of the Hoinerhof, he treasured his hikes in the nearby mountains “where no one has been since Walter and I were here, in the last eight or ten years, except maybe a woodcutter.”<span class="citation">30</span> His need for solitude was sometimes overwhelming. He wrote to Kate in July 1919, “I have such need of it that it is necessary and can’t be put off. You know that feeling, when the heart is unable to continue and must be alone. I will be blissful in my loneliness, in the wilderness.” His intense response to manifold impressions is touchingly recorded in his diary. This enthusiasm for life would in the future be one of the qualities that most endeared him to friends and acquaintances. Yet he was self-effacing and preferred to be in the background, except when making music.</p>
            
                            <p>In his senior year, Willi met an Italian girl who was staying with his aunt, Tanti. He took her on various walks around Munich, showing her Nymphenburg, the lovely summer palace of the Bavarian kings. Since it was late September, they saw a lot of autumn crocus, and he happily records in his diary that he will never forget that she told him the Latin name for it, colchicum autumnale. He also comments, “What a waste of time to have to go to school on such a gorgeous fall day!” A month later they visit Schäftlarn, a beautiful Baroque church in the Isartal. He thinks the girl likes him quite well, “even though for an Italian even more than for a German I am <em>brutissimo</em> (very brutish).” He finishes off with a charming non-sequitur, “Her entire spirit and her beautiful heart are reflected wonderfully in her body.”</p>
            
                            <p>Willi’s progress had all along been followed with loving commitment by his unmarried aunt and uncle. Hans and Bettli were both more intellectually inclined than their sister Reta. They did all they could to foster Willi’s interest in reading and music, and their pious, upright ways reinforced Reta’s seriousness. I now can’t believe that I never asked either of them how they developed their deep relationship to Greece and Rome, but I never did. I knew that Onkel Hans loved Greece and had actually been there, not at all a common experience among busy general practitioners serving a population of working-class patients. Bettli had been to Rome many times—when did she first go? I knew she stayed with intellectual friends somewhat above the Brunhübners’ station in life: how did she meet them? When and where did she learn Italian? She “raved” about Rome and Goethe a little bit <em>ad nauseam.</em> I would sometimes want to shout for mercy, alright, okay, I would growl to myself, he’s the greatest writer and it’s the greatest city, you told me already, a million times. One was never safe from some apt quote of the Herr Geheimrat, as I impiously came to call Goethe in my mind. Bettli made me a Goethe scrapbook filled with pictures, poems and quotes when I was about eight, and I actually applied myself to memorizing some of the writing, to my lasting benefit.</p>
            
                            <p>Hans and Bettli had a modest third-floor apartment in Haidhausen, a working-class district of Munich where almost all his patients lived. The apartment contained, in addition to living quarters, his consulting room and a waiting room that we children found fascinating. It had those spidery gold-painted chairs that dancing school rooms used to have: delicate, and to all appearances as unsuited to receiving sick people as they could possibly be. But the room also had some of Onkel Hans’s old art: reverse glass paintings that were fascinating to study. Hedi, my cousin Willi, Irmi and I each have one. Onkel Hans also had worry-beads from Greece. I still have a set. He was as devout a son of the Enlightenment as his sisters were children of all things Lutheran, and he took an annual vacation in Greece. We have a picture of him in a three-piece suit on what looks like a blazing hot day on the Acropolis. Hans had a very nice voice and sang with Munich’s Akademischer Gesangverein (Academic Choral Group) for forty years.</p>
            
                            <p>Onkel Hans was devoted to scholarly writings. He was the first person who mentioned Humboldt to me. I assumed he meant Alexander von Humboldt, as the incident is connected in my memory with Onkel Hans’s extravagant collection of tropical butterflies. The most spectacular one was a large blue one framed in glass. Would Onkel Hans have been pleased to know that I wrote my senior thesis at Smith about Wilhelm von Humboldt, Alexander’s older brother? And that Matthew, Hans’s great-grand-nephew, began his life in science with a butterfly collection? </p>
            
                            <p>Much of Onkel Hans’s collection occupied a wall in the Brunhübner living-room, near the oriel window where Thomi and I spent hours turning a couch into a sort of “African Queen,” a boat filled with cushions, blankets, and of course Proviant, provisions consisting mostly of candy and Tanti’s homemade cookies. The tropical butterflies and Tanti’s many houseplants provided a certain verisimilitude to the jungle, and stuffed animals the requisite wild beasts. I think of those imaginary journeys with utter contentment, they were our childish visit to Eden.</p>
            
                            <p>But I have strayed a long way from Willi’s youth and upbringing. It is time to look at one of the most fundamental elements in Willi’s life, music. Josef and Reta were, as already mentioned, musical. Although I never heard Reta sing, she undoubtedly sang as a child with Hans and Bettli, growing up as they did right across from the church, and undoubtedly singing hymns at Sunday service. Singing was a prominent feature of the school curriculum, and Pipsi, like his brother-in-law Hans, loved to sing. Willi records that on Josef and Reta’s twentieth anniversary, in April 1912, his father sang Loewe, a pleasing composer of the early 19th century. When Willi was born he must have been sung to a lot, being the first baby in such a music-loving family. By the time he was four he had his first violin. He had begged for a violin by nagging the grown-ups with a little song, </p>

                            <p>Willi does not mention violin lessons, but he must have had instruction. By the time he was seventeen he regularly played chamber music, taking the violin or cello part as needed. He played with people much older than he was, and more than held his own. Amateur chamber musicians were everywhere, so there was lots of opportunity to play. He also went to hear as much concert music as he could, and in pre-World War I Munich that was a good deal. Operas, masses, orchestra pieces, song recitals. His diary of 1911–12 is filled with touchingly fervent declamations like the one of October 3, 1911, having heard Schuberts’s Unfinished Symphony: “Oh Schubert! Your slow movement! Is there anything more beautiful among the Romantics?” and, on November 30, after a recital by Wilhelm Backhaus, “Now I know what playing Brahms is! Now I know Beethoven’s Sonata Les Adieux!” After a concert with Kreisler playing Beethoven violin sonatas, he writes: “Immortality, the joys of paradise…so close to the godhead, so close…I feel what a gift it is to be a human being, to own the starry sky, the mountains, music, even as a tiny worthless dwarf among dwarves.”</p>
            
                            <p>At the end of 1911 he reflects: “as to myself there was real progress for my musical side and my inner being, but almost none for the part of me related to studies and school.” On January 21, 1912, he writes: “Do you Philistines know something of music? Do you know the fury that sweeps along the person filled with holy madness?” At this time, Willi describes, as he goes on his way on foot to play quartets: [a] “musical household <em>comme il faut:</em> Jakob Heigel, old bourgeois Munich family…universal genius…in constant contact with artists of whom I already know several…wonderful music room with grand piano, large cupboard with music, violin and cello cases, wonderful oil paintings etc. etc. Herr Geigl first violin, second Herr Dr. Ewald Schäfer, good but not first-rate violinist. Viola, <em>Herr Postsekretär</em> Schleifer, an ideal musician who can play every instruments in a quartet, and piano as well, has an incredible knowledge of chamber music scores and is in addition a genial Swabian and not too cultivated (this is not ironical!), a man whom one has to like. Cello, me.” A few days later the players reconvene, but this time Willi is the violist and <em>Herr Präfect</em> Käsbohrer on cello. He is a prefect at the Institute for Noble Girls, and a wonderful cellist, also first-rate on all other strings, with an incredible breadth of knowledge (art!), young and well-disposed toward me.” In April 1912, just after his birthday, “What a pity that I never exercised my bow hand for fiddling. It hinders me incredibly. My dream is to become an artist, not to rear a cow that gives milk and butter and grazes in the cheap pastures of the public, but to let an eagle take wings inside me, to escape the commonplace from time to time and be able to animate others. God knows I truly love music, and I am not just trying to tell myself so.”</p>
            
                            <p>His musical intuition and good ear made progress easy for him. He was worried at his lack of serious application. His cello teacher, Fleissner, “gives me more credit than I really deserve. I can’t expect to be good not having practiced a single hour in two years. What I’m doing is a swindle. Damn it all, what can be done?” On April 25, 1912, he notes: </p>
            
                            <p>Yesterday I played the harmonium. I was so distressed that I’ve never learned to play the piano, because I’d have accomplished something with it. I notice that I lack any profound penetration of harmony…I would love to play the organ. It was a good harmonium with thirteen registers. ‘O Haupt’ from the St. Matthew Passion is wonderfully moving when one plays it like that.</p>
            
                            <p>I do not know whether Willi had any lessons in any of these instruments. Pipsi himself played the zither, not an easy instrument to play. Onkel Walter played the piano, and Elli had a beautiful soprano voice and some serious training. There was always a lot of music at the Baaderstrasse.</p>
            
                            <p>We can assume that in his first semester at the university Willi continued to take part in chamber music groups. His growing knowledge of the literature only served to feed his passion for music. The eighteen-year old writes, “the C-major quintet is for me the climax of Schubert’s spirit, the romantic ideal…the two celli sing in it as beautifully as only they can.” On Easter Sunday in Tegernsee “the church schedules the Coronation Mass by Mozart (cello)” he adds, and we must picture Willi walking down from the Hoinerhof to the lakeside church, carrying his cello “to play that indestructible piece which floats along so full of joy and merriment.” It was a rainy day, but “We didn’t pay attention to the rain, and after eating we marched off for a walk…And the evening was best of all, we danced and sang every single song we knew even halfway.” On Easter Monday, a holiday in Germany and most European countries, the weather had cleared. “We looked at the glory of the wintry mountains, the spring-like green valley and the shining mirror of the lake, and talking of this and that reached the chapel [at a nearby small peak] to bring our Easter sacrifice to God and his creation.” After walking the Easter visitors back to the Munich train, he describes his and Walter’s walk home: “...our walk back up the mountain at night under an indescribable sky full of stars that glittered and sparkled—everything so glorious and beautiful, and stored unforgettably in my memory.” On his nineteenth birthday, he writes: </p>
            
                            <p class="inset">I am sitting in the noonday sun. Round about the fields are shining white, the new snow is two feet deep, real winter. The sky is perfectly blue, and the view from the carpenter’s shed is wide, pure and beautiful…I feel so rich and happy, the bells of the monastery ring with their old familiar sound, the snow is dripping off the roof, the shadow of the firs is short…It is wonderful to celebrate in the midst of nature, one’s consciousness united with all those one loves…to savor the present with thankfulness and to think ahead full of hope.</p>
            
                            <p>There was a solar eclipse on April 17, that led Willi to write: “Our damned materialistic life will not allow us time or occasion to find values for our inner life, highest personal values, derived from knowledge of cosmic facts. When Kant, and with him Beethoven, says ‘Two things fill my heart with constantly renewed admiration…the starry sky above me and the eternal law within me,’ that should be the expression of the truest, most fervent and purest emotion of the individual.”</p>
            
                            <p>We have a physical description of the eighteen-year-old Willi written by himself, as unflattering as possible. “The cellist is really a violinist, medium height, bad teeth, big nose, a wart on his upper lip, a strange forehead, small head with a few strands of hair fluttering about (don’t worry, his hair is parted on the left again and smooth). The eyes are small, a watery, hazy blue without expression. His hands are not too big and bear evidence of rickets overcome. The middle finger of the left hand is also decorated with one or two warts. The nails are badly groomed.” Hmm.</p>
            
                            <p>In Willi’s 1931 passport the description is not so unflattering, just matter-of-fact: “Build a bit above average, face oval, eyes, grey-blue, hair, dark blond,” and his profession is listed as “writer,” his nationality as “Bavarian,” which on May 2, 1934, is crossed out and amended to “German Reich.” I bet he would have preferred to remain a Bavarian. </p>
            
                            <p>Bavaria had been governed by the Wittelsbach dynasty since 1180. Until 1805 the head of the government had been the Duke of Bavaria. (To this day some institutions, for example the Tegernsee brewery, call themselves “ducal Bavarian” to establish their superior age and authenticity over merely “royal.”) Napoleon made Duke Maximilian Joseph a king at the Treaty of Pressburg, and in 1818 this King Maximilian granted Bavaria a new constitution, with a bicameral legislature and religious freedom extended to the minority Protestants, something of an example for Germany at the time. His son Ludwig I reigned from 1825 to 1848, and we will return to him in a moment. He was followed by Maximilian II, until 1864, and then the mad King Ludwig II of Wagner and castle-building fame until 1886, when he was officially declared insane. Bavaria became part of the new German Empire in 1871, though it retained various functions such as an autonomous diplomatic service, military administration, postal and telegraphic service and railways. Ludwig II’s uncle Luitpold became regent in 1886, and served until he died in 1912. His son in turn became King Ludwig III, and served until the kingdom was replaced by the <em>Räterepublik</em> (Councils’ Republic) in November 1918, and the king fled. From the time Willi was born until he was 25, he grew up in a monarchy.</p>
            
                            <p>King Ludwig I deserves a little more attention than the other kings because the picture of Munich as it exists today (and as it was rebuilt after World War II) is the result of his planning, and the expenditure of 10,643,597 Gulden, an inconceivable amount of money. It resulted in the beautiful Ludwigstrasse, with buildings ranging from the University to various administrative buildings to the Staatsbibliothek (the state library), the opera, etc. The Ludwigstrasse with its continuation in Schwabing of the Leopoldstrasse, and the big gate in between, the Siegestor, which commemorates the 30,000 Bavarians killed in Napoleon’s Russian campaign, defines my childhood image of Munich. For Willi it meant the University, which Ludwig I transferred from Landshut to Munich in 1826, and even more personally the Bavarian State Library. “Where is Willi? Where is Vati?” — as often as not the answer was the library, his favorite haunt. He never took me there, come to think of it. Children were no doubt frowned upon by the library’s guardians.</p>
            
                            <p>There had been hunger and deprivation in Munich after the Napoleonic troubles and a bad harvest in 1816. The king and the nobility lived fairly modestly. There is a nice description by Jean Paul, a German writer, who paid the king a visit in 1820: “I went to see the king…With him all you have to do is to get the valet to announce you, any time between eight and ten. I never thought such a wide open, good-tempered, modest, unassuming, commonsensical king was possible.” When Ludwig succeeded his father, he took over as someone believing in the divine right of kings, knowing what is best for the country and its people. He ruled over an almost completely agrarian Bavaria. Like Jefferson, he was a passionate advocate of the farmer. Even the railroad and the steamship seemed instruments of dubious progress to him: “There can’t be any more talk of enjoying beautiful nature… like a packed-in, indifferent bit of goods man shoots through the most glorious views of nature. He no longer gets to know different lands.” And the steamer cannot make up for the loss of “looking at the landscape in a leisurely way…because whether wood or beasts to be slaughtered get there sooner or later, that is not important. But fishing can really suffer.” </p>
            
                            <p>Agriculture remained the chief occupation of Bavarians when I was born: eight million inhabitants depended primarily on agriculture for a living. By 1933 that number had fallen greatly. What industry there was consisted mostly of small and middling concerns. “Almost pre-industrial conditions prevailed in some crafts, such as the ubiquitous wood-carving workshops, whose many ‘home-workers’ often lived in miserable conditions and great poverty.”<span class="citation">31</span> Bavaria had been Christianized by St. Boniface, an Irish missionary, in the 8th century. He had founded the bishoprics of Salzburg, Regensburg and Freising, which later became Munich/Freising. Upper Bavaria, (the region with the highest altitude, therefore upper), closest to the Alps, had a population that was 89.5 per cent Catholic. Among the rural population the percentage was 95.8 per cent.</p>
            
                            <p>Willi spent almost his entire life in Bavaria, within a 50-mile radius of Munich. His trips to Italy, France, other European countries, and of course, to the rest of Germany, and his war service are the only exceptions. Yet he considered Bavarian separatists a lunatic fringe; writing to Kate in December 1918, he says: “Though much about Germany strikes me as hideously distasteful, I never loved Germany more than now in its misery. I am bitterly opposed to a crazy clique here, and would rather stop being a Bavarian if — it’s impossible! — Bavaria separated from Germany.” Willi’s attachment to the landscape and traditions of Bavaria was deep, and his pride in Bavarian customs and achievements is patent. He loved Munich, “with its blue sky and quiet nights,” he relishes looking out of a lecture hall window at the university, “with the sky over the Ludwigstrasse so blue, everything so green and fresh and the huge bouquets of wild flowers offered for sale on all the streets.”<span class="citation">32</span> </p>
            
                            <p>The Baaderstrasse apartment had a back room that gave on the garden, where Willi slept on a hot August night, “[with] the window open, the cool air is streaming in from the garden and one can hear the rushing of the brook in back, and then there is the far-away bustle of nocturnal Munich, very muffled by now. It’s pleasant,” he says, “ to be in the midst of the old city surrounded by a little comfortable, somewhat philistine nature, and I am grateful for it. Just now all the bells rang [midnight] from near and far.”<span class="citation">33</span></p>
            
                            <p>The Bavarian landscape elicits a paean of his praise on a visit to Tegernsee: “The profound quiet is well suited to arousing all my infinite memories. . .All that is best and most worthwhile in my life seems to me to dwell with magic power in these woods, these gentle mountains, these brooks. Half the years of our whole long joyful childhood took place here. Every tree, every mountain meadow is familiar, the new tree plantings grew along with us, we played in every alpine hut and built ponds and dams in every rill. I haven’t been here for more than a few days since 1913, and have so longed for all this. There’s a good deal of sentimentality in this tenacious, jealous love, but perhaps such deep feeling, such possession is what captivates and holds us most of all.” </p>
            
                            <p>When at the Hoinerhof, Willi wore the local outfit, “the short leather pants that leave the knees bare, the shirt of homespun linen, the two-part socks, one a short tube that covers only the calves and the other part for the feet. The Tegernsee hat is almost round and of dark-green velvet, with a few small heron feathers stuck in the band. It is one of the most beautiful costumes of our mountains.” He writes, “I always feel that with my city clothes I take off everything false, and with these I don my real self. I am blissful at the very thought of showing you everything up here. You’ll sleep under the same roof in one of the tiny, low rooms with their wooden walls. Everything is very primitive and only trees, mountains and a bit of sky peer through the windows.”<span class="citation">34</span> The next morning Willi reports: “I went off to the mountains, up into the beautiful high forests, without path or track. I was so happy, partly because I noticed that despite my wound I can still climb well. I came to trusty old places and slopes, completely solitary corners amidst steep rocks.”<span class="citation">35</span></p>
            
                            <p>Willi never wanted to live too far away from the mountains. All his life he would go off for a few days to hike in the Bavarian mountains, and often hiked with Kate and their friends. There are of course no letters to tell of this time the Schmids shared, but there are some photographs of their vacations. Willi was a close friend of Willy Merkl, a famous German mountain climber who was in charge of the German Nanga Parbat expedition in 1934, which ended with Merkl’s tragic death a few days after Willi perished.</p>
            
                            <p>This love of his native soil extended to the mountain flowers. He looked for Alpenrosen (wild azaleas) on the slopes near the Hoinerhof, regretted that wild cyclamen grow only in the Berchtesgaden region, pointed out that many of the most delicate mountain flora, like Turk’s cap lily, don’t survive picking well enough to send to Schwerin. He expounded the virtues of special wild roses, “the color of ivory, much more beautiful than ordinary ones, more delicate, more refined, rarer.” For Kate’s twentieth birthday on May 13, 1919, he had sent her gentians, which arrived safely, to the delight and admiration of not only Kate but also her family. At one point he sent wild helleborus niger (Christmas roses) to Schwerin and succeeded in eliciting astonished joy. That love of flowers and some preference for delicacy has come down to his descendants. Walking with anyone with Schmid connections can try the patience of people uninterested in flora.</p>
            
                            <p>In his priority list of places he wants to visit and walk with Kate, Bavaria leads the rest, followed by “the Tyrol, Salzkammergut, South Tyrol, Lake Garda, the Engadine, Switzerland in general, Lake Como, Florence and Rome.” In January 1921 he writes Kate from Allach, where he is teaching, “the sun is shining and a tremendous Föhn [the famous south wind that gives many people headaches] is blowing, storming, howling. This morning the mountains were strung like a blue, dark chain against the violet, reddening morning sky. Such an atmosphere is really unique to us here. I would like to have been standing on the terrace of the Dachau garden with you, in the same place where one time a sudden, passionate longing flooded us on a bright, flower-illuminated day. That is as unforgettable as the big bouquet the gardener made for you. We’ll have to go back for more, often, maybe this fall?” Dachau was a well-known artists’ colony during the 19th century, a very different image from what it evokes for us now.</p>
            
                            <p>He was determined to enchant Kate with all of Bavaria’s virtues. On June 30, 1921, he writes, “Yesterday was a wonderful evening, full of glowworms and innumerable gold stars, and all the big Midsummer Night fires were burning on the mountainsides (yesterday was Sts. Peter and Paul). It looked like a fairytale, almost too perfect.” In January, after the death of his friend Josef Wismeyer, a man who died of his war wounds almost three years after the war, Willi writes, “Oh darling, now the sun has come out and is dancing on this page, the jays are screaming indefatigably, the smith is hammering away, and the church clock is striking 11:45. A real Bavarian pastoral as if it was March. And now to top it all off a little baby is beginning to squeal. How this letter, which began with death, has come to a cheerful close after all.”</p>
            
                            <p>Bavarian though he may have felt, half his inheritance came from the family of his mother, Margarethe Brunhübner, who, as I have mentioned, grew up in the little village of Detwang down in the valley of the Tauber at the feet of Rothenburg. This is the one region of Bavaria where Protestantism predominates, “giving the Protestant faith there the peculiar intense piety characteristic of a diaspora.”36 The family lived on top of the school, just across the road from the church. There is a photograph of three of four surviving grandchildren (Hedi was not there) from 1998. The garden looked old and loved. That’s where our great-aunt, Bettli, must have learned her plant lore. Margarethe was the only one of the children who married. Bettli kept house for her younger brother Hans. My cousin Willi heard tales of Bettli’s jealousy of any young women in whom Hans showed an interest. She apparently made substantial efforts to keep Hans from marrying.</p>
            
                            <p>Bettli and Reta were extremely pious, with a somewhat Puritan manner of speech and attitude, and a truly unselfish sense of responsibility toward their fellow man. They were generous, caring, conscientious to a degree, truly “Christian” in the best sense. Hans did not seem to share this religiosity, but he did share the giving spirit: a more devoted, hard-working general practitioner one cannot imagine. Though beloved by his patients and in charge of a big practice, he never became even comfortably well-off, but remained with Bettli in their third-floor apartment in the Wörthstrasse. Sometimes the patients were able to pay, sometimes they were not. I occasionally overheard bits of sotto voce discussions between brother and sister, Bettli always being the one who nagged Hans about collecting what was owed him, and he demurring that Frau Bierlinger or whoever really could not pay just now.</p>
            
                            <p>The modest life style of Josef and Reta Schmid and of Hans and Babette was no source of discontent to them. They worked hard and conscientiously without great ambition to better their financial situation. They had enough for a respectable life rich in music, books, and the enjoyment of nature. Their business acumen was nil. They bore misfortune (like the inflation and the post-1929 economic crisis) with dignity and thrift, and hoped for better times. None but Babette lived to see those better times. Josef and Reta did not live to see Willi murdered, thank God. Josef died in the fall of 1933, and Reta in March 1934. Hans died in late summer of 1936. Babette (Tanti) lived until 1955.</p>
            
                            <p>Reta and Josef were close neighbors to Tanti, Reta’s sister. Willi had been the apple of her eye since he was a boy, and his murder must have been incomprehensible and close to unbearable for her. We children were the objects of her deep love. She showered us with attention, presents, opportunities for learning, outings. When we moved to Salzburg in 1937, it meant the end of constant comings and goings between Haidhausen and Schwabing, the two areas of Munich where the Brunhübners and we lived. We had “commuted” from our house to theirs from the time I was about seven, old enough to be in charge of Thomi while we took streetcar number 6 and then changed to number 12, and got off at Max-Weber Platz to walk the remaining few yards to the Brunhübners’ house.</p> 
            
                            <p>When we moved to Salzburg, Tanti must have felt bitterly lonely for us. She had lost Onkel Hans the year before, and coming to Salzburg on a visit was not the same: as a guest in Kate’s house she could not “do” for us the way she could in her own surroundings. The maids did not want her interfering in “their” kitchen. She did not know Salzburg well enough to seek out, as she did in Munich, surprising places that would please us with their beauty or yield special taste treats, or opportunities for acquiring treasures, like my doll-sized copper utensils from a Munich street fair. She was the one who showed me Munich’s version of the crystal palace, the Glaspalast, before it burned down, and I haven’t forgotten it to this day. She still had her other three great-nephews and great-niece Irmi, but they all lived in Garmisch and had never spent as much time with her as we did.</p>

                            <div id="loadFive"></div>
            
                            <p>Onkel Hans became Kate’s greatest support after Willi’s death. In his serious, understated way he was her mainstay and partisan. She could go to him and pour out her heart, he truly became the head of the family for her. It must be said that he is also the one who got her started on sleeping pills to which she became addicted in her old age. I do not hold Hans responsible for that, of course. </p>
            
                            <p>Hans was one of the first to observe the growing closeness between Kate and Hoerlin. As 1935 gave way to 1936, he accurately judged the relationship to be one of deep love. As a physician he was probably aware that his life was coming to an end. So he went to see Hoerlin to have a serious talk with him. Hoerlin and Hans were well suited to one another: both only sons, both Protestant and serious, both utterly upright, conscientious and exact, and from adjoining regions of Germany. Those homogenous regions were still significant in those days. I do not know whether they remain a factor in ease of communication nowadays. I was not aware of the meeting between the two men until I started work on this chronicle. It makes me sad to know that I might have talked with Hoerlin about it. I think Hans asked Hoerlin to take care of Kate and her children, an astonishing revelation on the part of the usually exceptionally discreet Hans. He died in August of 1936, sending Kate and her children scurrying back from Italy. Kate now had no one of the older generation left.</p>
            
                            <p>I have one more memory of Tanti, when we came back to Munich for a last visit just before Kate and Hoerlin were married in 1938. Tanti and I started out from the Wörthstrasse on the number 12 streetcar, and took it way downtown to the Karlsplatz, where Munich’s best toy shop, Oberpollinger, was located. I may have been thirteen years old but the spell of that wonderful emporium was as magical as ever. Tanti said that I could pick out whatever I wanted, so I would have a memento of her in America. A memento! Of Tanti! Didn’t I have dolls, doll dresses, doll furniture, colored pencils in all shades of the rainbow, scrapbooks (especially the one with the Goethe-sayings…), nighties, books, a little ivory Madonna in a wooden shrine with doors that closed, postcards of a trip with her to Rothenburg — oh please, Tanti, you must be joking.</p>
                            
                            <p>I knew she was not joking, and that the heaviness of my own heart was nothing compared to her heartache. So she and I with our aching hearts walked through the aisles of toys for a long time, till I knew I must pick something, that it was time to face our parting. So I picked: it was a Steiff zebra, a high-legged elegant little thing that charmed me utterly. I still have it. I never let my children play with it, though I showed it to them on special occasions.</p>
            
                            <p>This episode also reveals something of the Schmids’ and Brunhübners’ attitude toward money. Their daily life was frugal in the extreme, yet they did not hesitate to spend in a kind of grand manner when the occasion warranted. Goodness knows what was the extravagant cost of the zebra. On that day, for that purpose, money was no object. This style was handed down in the family. There does not seem to be a trace of stinginess, let alone avarice, in any Schmid descendant. Most of us are far better off than any of Willi’s generation or their parents, but I think we would agree with the sentiments of a Greek quote found on Willi’s desk after his death: “May thou not suffer want nor yet dream of riches.”</p>

                        <section>
                                <p>As has been said over and over, the Great War was the critical turning point, away from values and assumptions that had reigned for a very long time. <em>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,</em> declaim the letters carved on Newton’s War Memorial. How many people in our time really believe that it is sweet and proper to die for one’s homeland?</p>
            
                                <p>The twenty-year-old Willi who rushed home to Munich from Rome (“on the last train,” his mother writes to Jablonski in 1915) was a patriot without question. Like millions of other Europeans he would have no inkling, when he obtained a certificate from the University of Rome on July 30, 1914, of his fate in the next four and a half years. “Schmid Guglielmo da Giuseppe di Weilheim (Baviera)” had been enrolled in a course in <em>“litteratura neolatina,”</em> and one in <em>“litteratura italiana”</em> in the summer of 1914. He had formed a friendship with Walter Jablonski, and had enjoyed his own youth, strength and promising future.</p>
            
                                <p>Back in Germany, and after a few months of military training Willi, an Einjähriger, a one-year volunteer, was assigned to a reserve batallion, the 20th Infantry Regiment, and by April 19, 1915, was fighting in France. On May 2, 1915, Willi wrote to Marianne Grossman (the kindly person who had financed his stay in Rome) to say that after eight days in the trenches he had just returned to behind the lines in Bellay. He had been an orderly serving between the trenches and the reinforcements, and had to cover a 25-minute journey along the narrow trench, almost an hour back and forth, sometimes three or four times a night. He experienced varieties of weather: a sky full of stars, the moon shining, rain—and all while infantry projectiles whizzed overhead. He heard the “sharp, brief crack that was a sign that the bullet passed very close by.” He listened to the thunder of the artillery:</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first">...the dry, hard burst of a grenade hit, which moved through the air howling, and the uncanny whistling and whizzing of shrapnel. The second night I had to make contact with all the pickets and listening posts. It is a strange feeling to be that close to the enemy. You look out of the lookout till your eyes hurt, because when the bullets fly, you duck down. …The last night and the last day I was on duty in the trench between 3 and 5 a.m., between 11 and 1, and from 7 to 9 in the evening… I saw a few Frenchmen in the trees, and I scared them off pretty fast. If a comrade hadn’t lent me his Zeiss binoculars I would never have seen those fellows aiming at the trench from up there. The morning duty was lovely: an early spring morning. It got light slowly, the warm smell of the earth rose from the field, and the larks could not get enough of their morning song. At the edge of the woods, near the French trenches, I saw a white hawthorn blooming—in peacetime I would have walked over there to watch the sun come up. But it is war and I am not allowed to look for the sun—it will rise in its spring splendor and will shine on friend and foe. It will rise if I should die, it will always reawaken life, and bestow it. The work of creation and the passing away will continue in inexorable majesty surpassing the generations. That was what the ancient Greeks thought, and Hölderlin, that favorite of the Gods.</p>
            
                                <p>By September he had been made a corporal, transferred to the First Infantry, and was fighting in South Tyrol. In October 1915 he participated in the Serbian campaign, and caught typhus. This led to hospitalization and, on December 28, 1915, to transfer to a military hospital in Göttingen. While there, he met the Runge family and played chamber music with Nina Runge (Courant), which Nina later recalled in her condolence letter to Kate, after Willi’s death.</p>
            
                                <p>Willi’s recovery was slow. In March 1916 he was transferred to a hospital in Adelholzen, in the Allgäu, and from there to Immenstadt (Allgäu) and a convalescent company. A photograph of the 23-year-old Willi from 1916 shows the ravages of illness and war in his face. By August he was enrolled in an officer’s candidate school in Grafenwöhr, from which he emerged a sergeant. He got back into combat as an infantryman in 1917, fighting in battles for “the liberation of the Bukovina,” according to his military records. There was hard fighting both in the Bukovina and later, in October 1917, on the bitterly contested Isonzo River in Friuli/Venezia Giulia in northeastern Italy, northwest of Trieste. I assume that his unit was part of the German 14th Army, consisting of two Austrian and two German divisions and commanded by the (German) General Otto von Below. They took Cividale on October 27 and Udine on October 28, 1917. On November 13, 1917, Willi was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class “for demonstrated bravery.”</p>
            
                                <p>He was now part of a mountain troop, referred to himself as a “skier,” and wrote contentedly to Jablonski that though it was bitterly cold, the mountain landscape was surpassingly beautiful and “we hear little from the Italians.” Willi was attached to Brigade Command as an Italian interpreter from October 29, 1917, to February 12, 1918.</p>
            
                                <p>His unit received additional training behind the Austrian lines in Friuli and Venezia in preparation to being sent to Lorraine in early March 1918. There they lay in trenches and participated in some of the great battles in France, on the Ancre, the Somme and the Avre. There the German 17th Army under von Below advanced more than 21 miles and took 70,000 Allied prisoners as well as 1,100 guns, while aiming to capture Amiens. Amiens was saved for the Allies by an Australian tank force on April 24, 1918, but Willi was no longer fighting. He was hit in the abdomen by machine gun fire on April 23, near Moreuil. A German medical officer walked over the battlefield where Willi lay among the dead and wounded, to pick out those for whom there was still hope. They were to be taken to a field hospital on stretchers. When the officer judged a soldier to be close to death, he would say moribundus to the orderlies, meaning that the man should be left to die. The Latin word is easily understood by English-speakers: <em>moribund;</em> but a German speaker would not know it unless he knew Latin. When Willi heard it and realized he was to be left for dead, he lifted his arm to show that he was alive and aware, and was put on a stretcher. “I was operated on almost immediately by an excellent surgeon” he wrote to Jablonski.<span class="citation">37</span></p>
            
                                <p>He was eventually moved to the Charlottenburg military hospital in Berlin. There, there was no more shelling and no more filth, and morphine dulled consciousness as well as pain. Yet the hospital filled with the maimed, screaming and groaning wounded must have been reminiscent enough of the hardships and horrors of the Somme. We can only imagine the suffering, with awe and overwhelming pity. There is no word of complaint about his service nor about the conduct of the war in Willi’s correspondence. There is only one comment, in October 1920, when he writes to Kate that: “it is a good thing that we didn’t love each other before and during the war. All I know is I would have deserted twenty times over for your sake.”</p>
            
                                <p>By June 1918, Willi was strong enough to be transferred again, this time to Munich’s Krankenhaus rechts der Isar, the hospital on the right bank of the Isar, as it is called to this day. Willi was awarded the Military Cross of Merit Second Class, “with swords,” by the King of Bavaria. The war continued to rage, but now at least Willi was home in Munich, where his family could visit him. Tanti came on daily visits, often bringing along treats to tempt him to eat. His mother did the same, and brought along his beloved books that began to be piled around his bed. </p>
            
                                <p>Tanti, writing to Hoerlin sixteen years later, says:</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first">You know how much Willi liked to spend time with us. Once he said that his name was really Willi Schmid, born Brunhübner. Why couldn’t one just sign one’s name like that? Willi managed to retain that childishness his whole life, that childishly mirthful way, ready for fun. When I think back to the seven months in the hospital...at the torment of the belly wound. I was with him every day, mornings and evenings. Hans was in the army, his father [Pipsi] in the surgical clinic, still seriously ill—and even afterwards, recuperating at Elli’s in the country, still without a clue. [I do not know what was wrong with Pipsi at the time.] Willi always tried to be cheerful, despite the horrible pain. When it got to be unbearable, he would send me away. He was really brave…He never moaned and groaned, and made my coming and going as easy as could be.</p>
            
                                <p class="inset last first">But, I had to conjure up, from nothing, those Christmas cookies that he loved so much! He was stubbornly persistent but amiable, as only he could be. So the Christmas cookies appeared, in the middle of the summer. Relatives from Franconia, kind people here, and sugar accruing to Onkel Hans [who because of diabetes couldn’t have any]…all helped to bring about what Willi Schmid, born Brunhübner, most wanted.</p>
            
                                <p>He expressed admiration for the ordinary German soldier, and said that he found it surprisingly easy to adjust to military life. His behavior as a soldier was rated “Very good” on his official discharge, followed by “Punishments none”. He thanked God that he got away without the loss of a limb. Willi, an apt and skilled athlete, had both the agility and endurance to be expected of a boy raised in the mountains. He does permit himself to mourn the physical shortcomings resulting from his injuries. In a December 1918 letter to Kate he writes: “My former elasticity and strength are gone and may take years to regain. I can’t run and jump any more and I am a shadow of my former self. Can you love such a cripple?” She must look to the inner man, who has stayed whole, he told her. </p>

                                <div id="loadSix"></div>
            
                                <p>In some of his letters Willi reflects on the obligations of those who survived the war, on the memory of those who sacrificed their lives. He writes that at one time he became so despondent that he no longer wanted to live. As to the reality of the war, he suggested that Kate read Henri Barbusse, Under Fire, for a true description. Barbusse fought in the French army but became a pacifist. Willi’s positive response to him is another instance of Willi’s independence of thought, his catholicity of taste in people and opinions.</p>
            
                                <p>Just naming some of the battles in which Willi participated evokes the horror of what he must have experienced. Much has been written about the well-nigh unbearable ghastliness of trench warfare, the filth, the rats, the noise, the sleeplessness, the wet, the constant fear of bombardment. Willi was able to bear it. He never spoke to us children about it except to remind us to pray for the dead soldiers, and to show every kindness and courtesy to the many disabled veterans one saw daily on Munich streets and in the trolleys and trains. He never mentioned to us that he was disabled. We asked why he wore a whole bathing suit instead of trunks like most other fathers. “I have scars from the war” he said in a tone of such finality that no further questions came to us.</p>
            
                                <p>The fact that the German soldiers who had lived through the terrors of that conflict came back to a defeated country, that there was no glory in their heroism as there was in that of the Allied soldiers, must have made it an inexpressibly sad homecoming. These men had served their country with as much devotion and courage as the victors, yet the sacrifice of “the best years of their lives” came to worse than nothing. The Versailles Treaty guaranteed that for most of the veterans there would be the bleakest possible prospects. Pre-war aims and goals faded away. One could not recapture the years, and the present was so completely out of joint that institutions and members of the older generation were ill equipped for giving extra support to the young or to launch them on their way. Only the most privileged could take up where they had left off, and Willi was not one of these.</p>
                                
                                <p>In August 1918 the full extent of Germany’s loss of the war was yet uncertain; the armistice and the Versailles Treaty lay in the future. Willi’s life was circumscribed by his room in the hospital. His immediate goal was only to gain back his strength, yet he was so emaciated by pain and morphine, and at times so discouraged, that he was tempted to give up. It was in that hospital room that Kate appeared like a bright angel, full of life and warmth, a radiant beauty, his great love.</p>

                                <p>No one who met my mother seems ever to have forgotten her. In 1998 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, more than 10 years after Kate had died at age 86, a friend assured me, “She was a great woman.” We children probably suspected that fact more than we accepted it. To us she was a force of nature, powerful, in charge, untiring. Not a day has gone by since her death that I have not thought of her with love and longing. That was not at all always the case when she was alive. The pressure that emanated from her kept her children groaning and exclaiming to each other during many years of phone calls among ourselves. The “small person” she was—which was a source of pride to her, those size 8 dresses—the small person was a powerhouse. We children alternated between delightedly basking in her love and being furious at the often high-handed, manipulative conduct with which she got her way. We often found our mother’s wiles pretty resistible, and certainly had little notion of the amount of effort required on her part to give the impression of a continual feast. We, and others, experienced the remarkable powers of her intuition, and they continued to impress us. It is not simple to describe Kate.</p>
            
                                <p>Kate Tietz began life as a bastard child, although I do not believe that she was aware of that fact, at least consciously, for the first twenty years of her life. We have no knowledge of what tensions her conception may have occasioned between husband and wife. Adolf Tietz and Hedwig Pinner had been married in 1883 in Glogau, Silesia, where Hedwig had been born twenty years before. (During the Civil War! my grandmother!) They had two sons, Michael and Friedrich, called Fredi. The former was a business associate of his father, Adolf, in the store in Königstrasse in Schwerin; the latter became a physician. The family may have been related to Hermann Tietz of the great department stores in Berlin and Munich: Kate speaks of her “big business” relatives at a family gathering in Berlin in April 1919. It is certain that Adolf Tietz was related to the mathematician Felix Hausdorff, a professor in Greifswald and Bonn whose mother was a Tietz. Our Oma Hedi’s writing style and interests show that the Pinners were typical of thousands of German Jews, assimilated, “enlightened,” steeped in German culture, and interested in intellectual matters. Despite widespread reluctance on the part of Jewish families and outright prohibition on the part of Orthodox Jews toward marriages to Christians, Hedwig’s brother Max Pinner wrote an urbane, warm letter to Willi Schmid’s family on the occasion of Kate and Willi’s engagement, dwelling on his good impressions of Bavarian churches and Catholicism in a most kindly, courteous manner.</p>
            
                                <p>Hedwig’s sister, Tante Liese, had married a physician, Hermann Bohm, and led a comfortable life in Hamburg until 1938 when the Nazis stopped Jewish doctors from practicing (they had not been allowed to treat non-Jewish patients since 1936). Hermann and Liese Bohm survived Theresienstadt where he worked as a physician and in 1946 joined their son Martin, who had emigrated to Chicago in 1938. Kate and Hoerlin and I welcomed the Bohms to New York, but I had no further contact with them thereafter, and Kate almost never spoke of them. I believe, but am not certain, that Martin Bohm was not married. I had the impression that my mother did not like him much, though she loved her auntie and loved and respected her Uncle Hermann. Kate’s slight awe of Uncle Hermann may date from an event in her teenage years. On one of her trips to Hamburg, having been put in a train seat by her mother, Kate discovered that another compartment on the train was occupied by a whole group of sailors returning to their ship. They were singing and full of fun, and invited her to join them, which she promptly did. Uncle Hermann came to the station to pick her up at the seat specified by her mother, only to see her emerge further off in the company of all those sailors. He was so scandalized by her shocking disregard of the proprieties that he immediately wired her mother that they could not take responsibility for a girl so completely lacking any sense of appropriate behavior, and that he would therefore send her back to Schwerin on the next train. Such exaggerated punctiliousness was a symptom of society under Wilhelm II — poor Kate.</p>
            
                                <p>The name of 25-year-old Adolf Tietz can be found in the Schwerin directory for the first time in 1882, the year before he married Hedwig Pinner. Advertisements for his store appear in two directories regularly, and we know that the Tietzes lived, essentially, “above the store,” though since store and apartment were located in a corner house, the store’s address is Königstrasse 46, and the family address is Grosser Moor 2. The Tietzes and a couple named Löser owned the house. The store sold some furniture, but mostly lamps and knick-knacks. The sum of my knowledge of Kate’s childhood comes from a very few reminiscences she shared with her children. What glimpses of her family life she allowed us were all carefully censored. Some additional information is contained in a relatively small number of letters from Kate to Willi written in 1919. The letters are full of joy, life, and warmth, written in a pure, vigorous German, neither girlish nor dated. The accounts of her daily activities evince her prodigious energy and drive. She speaks of Adolf Tietz as “father”, and there is no reference to her illegitimate origin. But, in fact, she was conceived during her mother’s extramarital liaison with a <em>Freiherr</em> (Count) von Alvensleben whose first name I do not know. The Alvenslebens were an extensive family belonging to the <em>Junkers</em> (landed nobility).</p>
            
                                <p>The household Kate grew up in was one in which the high Jewish holidays were kept, and most social intercourse took place within the small Jewish community of Schwerin. Adolf Tietz was an active and fairly prominent member of the Jewish religious community and he, Hedwig and Michael were all buried in the Jewish cemetery. The Jewish cemetery in Schwerin was partly destroyed by the Nazis; the Tietz’s graves are gone, houses built over the plots.</p>
            
                                <p>Childhood photographs of Kate show a sweet and self-possessed girl; one taken with her mother reflects a deeply affectionate mother-daughter relationship. High spirits distinguished Kate from earliest childhood. At age three, dressed in white silk to visit relatives in Berlin, she sat down on the sidewalk of Unter den Linden, where the elegant world promenaded, and refused to budge, driving her mother eventually to scream at her in total exasperation, “But child, these are your closest relatives! I’m going to murder you!” When a policeman appeared to see what was going on, both mother and daughter were shocked into proceeding on their way as though nothing had happened. When still a very little girl, Kate left the square near her house to follow a hurdy-gurdy man, dancing to the music and curtsying when people put pennies in his box, until her frantic mother discovered and retrieved her.</p>
            
                                <p>During her early years at school Kate had a best friend, Käthe Detmering, and decided that she wanted to live with the Detmerings for a while. Her mother and Frau Detmering went along with this scheme apparently because Kate’s determination was impervious to all pleas and threats. Her stay with the Detmerings seems to have been salubrious. Kate spoke of Frau Detmering throughout her life as “the kindly spirit of my childhood.” Frau Detmering gave Kate a watercolor painting of Schwerin as a wedding present. It accompanied Kate and us on every move, and since her death I have had it. It shows the expanse of the lake with the little city in the distance, its cathedral spire the only notable vertical object. In addition to the Detmerings, Kate was a life-long friend of Margrethe von Bassewitz, later von Cochenhausen, and of Hilde Kolle and Inge Müller, whose maiden names I do not know, none of them Jewish.</p>
            
                                <p>Kate never lost her pride in Schwerin as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg, complete with castle, opera house/theater, museum, and of course the Grand Ducal family which set the tone for the local society. Dorothy von Moltke, the mother of the German anti-Nazi resistance hero Helmuth von Moltke, describes Schwerin in one of her letters as she experienced it in 1932:</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">[Schwerin] is a charming little city, near seven large lakes with swans and so on, glorious old beech forests and beautiful old buildings and streets that might have come out of a book of fairy tales. We went on a steamboat trip on part of one of the lakes but could never see the far shore, that’s how big it was... We took an enchanting walk in the castle park—a little like Schönbrunn, but in better shape.</p>
            
                                <p>Kate loved nature, and used the big lake as a place to play, swimming and boating to her heart’s content. The Tietz household included a manservant, Friedrich (called by Kate a “butler”—I doubt it!) and his wife, Bertha. I am not certain of their exact duties (they may have had more to do with the shop than with the family) but Kate often told how Friedrich covered for her when, as frequently happened, she came back late from sailing on the lake. As her loyal friend, Friedrich would tell her mother that Kate couldn’t have been expected to be on time—the wind was against her—no matter how the wind actually stood. She remained in touch with Friedrich and Bertha into their old age, and as late as 1959 they sent her a carefully assembled scrapbook of pictures of Schwerin—and Lubeck marzipan. This was at a time when Schwerin was part of East Germany, and marzipan must have been rare and precious indeed. It tells us something about Kate’s loyalty, and also about the atmosphere in the Tietz house.</p>
            
                                <p>Hedwig Tietz, our Oma Hedi, seemed a somewhat formidable person to us children. She was short but her beautiful posture made her seem taller, and impressive. She dressed carefully, spoke elegant German, was strict about the proprieties and generally commanded respect. She had a fine soprano voice and was sometimes invited to sing in as far away—and glamorous—places as Hamburg as a soloist in oratorios. Music was important to her, and Kate had piano lessons and was taken to concerts and the opera to expose her to the all-important <em>Bildung</em> [culture], so indispensable for social standing at the time. Perhaps it was Oma Hedi’s training as a singer that caused her to speak such beautiful German. She pronounced her words precisely and without regional accent and taught Kate to do the same. It was part of the Tietz pride in German culture, an important virtue in the canon of middle-class Jews. It is what set Jews from the German-speaking world apart from “Eastern” Jews, and caused them to be seen as deluded snobs by Yiddish-speaking people from Poland, Ukraine and Russia. In Germany and Austria, Yiddish was frowned upon, and even the few Yiddish words like, say, <em>meshugge</em> or <em>Schlemiel</em>, that had infiltrated German were avoided by “cultured” families.</p>
            
                                <p>When looking back at the early twentieth century, it is easy to smile at German obsession not only with behavior but Bildung. Germans proportionately bought—and read—more books than any other Europeans. Every little town had a theater and an opera house, and an astonishing number of people played musical instruments. Chamber and symphonic concerts were ubiquitous, and Hausmusik common as could be. Theater flourished. </p>
            
                                <p>Kate must have gone to the ordinary public school since she never mentioned any special elementary school. The standard pattern would have been to leave the primary school after the fourth grade, and at that point I believe Kate was enrolled in a type of high school called a <em>Höhere Töchterschule.</em> It was a girls’ high school that did not lead to university, but assumed the girls would leave school at about age sixteen to eighteen, and were to be primarily prepared for marriage. Kate’s class was small, about fourteen girls. She excelled in German. At the time German included much memorization of poetry and famous passages from plays, so that Kate to the end of her life could recite a large number of works ranging from Goethe, Schiller, Shakespeare, and Rilke, to German ballads. Shakespeare enjoyed a special place in the curriculum. The famous Schlegel-Tieck translation of his plays completed at the beginning of the nineteenth century is so astonishingly excellent that it made Shakespeare a staple of the German stage. Kate could quote whole sections of his plays in German. She did not have as strong a talent for math as for language, but she was clearly very bright, so that and her charisma once earned her a wholly undeserved 1, the equivalent of an A, from a math teacher who, on being asked by a surprised, happy Kate how she had achieved this distinction, said, “Because you could, if you tried.”</p>
            
                                <p>Kate learned to speak and write good French, and some English. When she was sixteen, in the summer of 1915, she was sent to a boarding school in Dresden for “finishing.” Every indication is that the Tietzes were quite well off before the war, and that their fortunes declined afterward. The oldest son, Michael, served in the war. The store probably did not flourish during the war; business must have been slow. The disastrous consequences of the war left few Germans with means for purchasing furniture or decorative objects, and the immediate post-war years were followed by the catastrophic inflation. By that time Adolf Tietz was ailing with an unnamed malady that led to his death in April 1924. The business was increasingly managed by Michael.</p>
            
                                <p>I was told of only two occasions on which Kate saw her real father. At one time Oma Hedi took Kate to a vacation spot—resort town? spa?—where they met a man on horseback during the course of a walk, “and I knew, I simply knew that that man was my real father,” Kate told me. It is a measure of how forbiddingly intimidating Kate was with us children regarding family secrets that although I asked her how she knew, I never got an answer, and, more significantly, I never brought up the subject again. Our friend Rose Bethe told me that Kate had talked to her about spending time on her father’s, Alvensleben’s, estate in Pomerania during some summers. Was that true, or wishful thinking, or did it only happen when she was very small? She never mentioned it to me, or Hedi or Bettina. Bettina Warburg, a New York friend and practicing psychoanalyst whose relationship with Kate was fraught with mutual disapprobation, said that she absolutely believed Kate’s story of her illegitimate origin and her <em>Junker father.</em></p>
            
                                <p>The Tietz family in which Kate grew up was, as far as we know, an observant Jewish family. We have surviving documents that prove Adolf Tietz’s active participation in the affairs of the Jewish community. The Jews of Schwerin were few in number. We can probably know most of their names from surviving burial society lists, which include Adolf and Hedwig Tietz. It is hard to know how much overt anti-Semitism there was, but certainly Kate’s friendships imply a certain amount of tolerance. Among the boys in Kate’s circle of friends (remember that schools were segregated by gender) was Herbert Faull, who became a cavalry officer in World War I, and whom I therefore assume not to have been Jewish, and Nito Büsing, a future lawyer. Nito Büsing was a nationalist and anti-Semite who, however, considered Kate an exception among members of her race, the famous “some of my best friends are Jews.” Herbert, “whom I never kissed,” Kate writes to Willi, was two or three years older than Kate, and very much in love with her. He wrote poems to her, and patiently put up with her childishness and the many other boys who trailed her.</p>
            
                                <p>She once called off a tennis game with him by asking a professor of Latin, who taught at both their schools, to take a note from her to Herbert, and to please deliver it at his next class. A German professor used as a messenger! The poor man was so stunned by the chutzpah of the request that he actually complied: he delivered the note. But as the outrage of the thing came over him, he complained to the principal about Kate’s behavior. When she was therefore called on the carpet, she said with unsinkable self-possession, “But <em>Herr Direktor,</em> could you have thought of a quicker way to get the message to Herbert?”</p>
            
                                <p>Kate told Willi that Herbert Faull was killed in the last days of the war, and that his poems, which she saved, reminded her of a lovely time in her life, that she treasured them. “He would have become a fine man and human being,” she writes. “He always loved me with the same steady love, and only in the last few months of his life did I realize his worth.”<span class="citation">38</span></p>
            
                                <p>After a visit to the university town of Rostock (the university dates from 1419), Kate writes on June 28, 1919, that she saw Nito Büsing there, and found out that he had given a political speech, for the German <em>Volkspartei</em>, and his anti-semitic views had stirred up debates that went on till 3 a.m. She decided to confront him,</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first"> ...as he had always carefully avoided the subject of politics with me, though I sensed that it occupied him profoundly. So I asked him what was the sense of being on good terms with each other based on silence and caution, and heard his political confession... It was the first time he and I had discussed this. You know, when I saw what a jolly and peaceful aspect all that business has in Rostock, with the colorful caps and ribbons [of the fraternities], and how these fops, the whole bunch of conceited dandies, dominate the character of the town and everything that happens there, I could no longer hide my displeasure. Nito is also rigorously opposed to all that nonsense, but when I spoke of how <em>unfair</em> [sic, in English] I consider it when 2,000 fraternity members advance against 150 Jewish students, he was silent. But I wanted to force him to talk about it and continued to express my conviction that they might be opposed in an open and honest fashion, but that utterly sordid anti-semitic pamphlets should not be posted on blackboards or distributed in seminars. He then stated his dissent, his various objections, and we talked back and forth for a long time…But even with this logician I found that it was as if he had absorbed a feeling of deep repugnance with his mother’s milk. And you see, the more someone considers me an exception from the rest of my people the more actively my sympathy grows for those hated and slandered people. And at that point I am indifferent to the fact that I never felt the manifestations of enmity — everything within me tenses with absolute readiness to resist the effort to degrade the people from whom I am descended to second-class citizens. I am not well-read or well-educated in this regard, but I suppose my instinct leads me to the right conclusion. But then, love, I wonder whether the majority of my people is not quite foreign to me, and that I am considered an outsider [sic, in English] by my family—where do I belong? It seems I can’t settle down anywhere, I who so condemn everything equivocal, any sort of wavering and vacillation.</p>
                                <p class="inset first last">And now I come to you with everything that puzzles me, and put my heavy heart into your hands...</p>
            
                                <p>We have no other document that reveals anything like the sense of identification with her Jewishness that Kate demonstrates in this quoted letter. It is the only evidence that she had had discussions about anti-semitism, and her reference to “the feeling of deep repugnance” that had been absorbed by Germans, “with [their] mother’s milk,” makes one tremble with the memory of what was to come.</p>
            
                                <p>I suspect that at that time Hedwig Tietz had not yet had a frank talk with Kate about her illegitimate origin. Why otherwise would Kate wonder to Willi where she belonged? It seems fair to assume that her mother explained the circumstances of her birth to Kate when she became engaged to Willi. His first reference to the “event that brought you about” is in 1920. Also, on June 14, 1921, Willi writes,</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">I am sure your father contributed to you as much as your mother. That’s one reason why I would like to know some day what he was like, his personality, nature and life. It’s just because of our children, who will inherit qualities from him as much as from us. — To be honest, I am very curious indeed concerning the product of our difference. I hope to God he, she will be musical! What I’d really like to do is to offer a vow to St. Cecilia [the saint of music] to help us.</p>
            
                                <p>He often thought about their children. In July 1919, he had written, “I often think—please don’t be cross with your dreamer, my dearest love—what our child may be like, more varied and richer than we, so nourished by two worlds which in us do not hate and flee one another, but want to embrace each other warmly and fervently.”</p>
            
                                <p>The anti-semitism, much of it below the surface, that was everywhere in Germany has been described by the historian Fritz Stern with great understanding, balance and dignity. Read him to gain some idea of the prevailing atmosphere. Even Willi, liberal and deeply in love with Kate as he was, did not shun mentioning the “instinctive” repulsion caused by “average” Jews. Willi’s beloved friends, the Jablonskis, could not of course be considered “average.” In this regard they resembled Adolf Tietz’s relations, the Hausdorffs. Felix and Lotte Hausdorff were as much of an influence on Kate as the Bohms in Hamburg. During Kate’s childhood and youth, Felix was a professor of mathematics at the University of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea. He was musical and the author, under a pseudonym, of some highly romantic novels. He and his wife Lotte were very fond of young Kate, and kind and helpful to her and Willi once the two were married.</p> 
            
                                <p>Nora Hausdorff, the daughter and only child of the house, was Kate’s age, and came to stay with her in Schwerin in 1920. The girls had fun, but Kate seems to have muttered in her letters to Willi that Nora was a bit spoiled. But — she did have an elegant wardrobe, and Kate thoroughly enjoyed trying on her clothes, envying her a little.</p>
            
                                <p>The Hausdorffs wrote deeply loving letters to Kate after Willi was killed, offering moral and financial support. The latter is particularly admirable, because by that time Felix had been dismissed from his teaching position as a prominent member of the University of Bonn’s mathematics faculty. There is a terrible ending to their story. Nora married a non-Jew, and for the sake of her own survival appears to have separated herself as much as possible from her parents. (Michael Burleigh’s <em>The Third Reich</em> [Hill and Wang, New York: 2000], traces the treatment of the Jews from chicanery to terror to annihilation.) When the Hausdorffs’ received an order from the Gestapo in January 1942 to report to Endennich, Felix Hausdorff punned on that town’s name, which can be understood as <em>Ende nich</em> (not the end). He said that he knew well that their stay in that town would not be the end. He, his wife Lotte and her sister took poison. He left a note apologizing to his lawyer for the trouble they were causing him. There is a street in Bonn named for Felix Hausdorff.</p>
            
                                <p>There seems to me to have been some inconsistency in the Tietzes’ educational aims for Kate. Possibly its root lies in a disagreement between Adolf and Hedwig. On the one hand, Kate’s upbringing was that of a young lady. On the other hand, she learned to type, and was expected to help in the store before she was eighteen. Her letters contain no complaints about this, and she never mentioned her commercial training to me.</p>
            
                                <p>There are some aspects of Kate’s personality that have not been mentioned so far. One would be hard put to find a harder worker, a person more willing to put herself out to create an atmosphere conducive to achieving an end. She did this with so much grace, flexibility and humor that others barely noticed any effort. If the goal was another’s, she went along without a murmur. If the goal was one of her own, she managed most of the time not to look manipulative. Others tended to think that their participation in whatever enterprise Kate favored was entirely voluntary. We children would marvel at how much manipulation people would put up with, like lambs.</p>
            
                                <p>Part of her immense charm was her energy, her boundless willingness to take pains. To achieve what seemed important and desirable to her, she would work with single-minded concentration. One example is the book she sent to Willi for his twenty-fifth birthday. She writes: “I had told the new bookdealer that I had to have a pre-war edition — it shows you that if people just try hard!...It’s also so nicely blue and gold, just the way many, many of your days in the new year should be.” It helped, of course, that she was very bright, but she was also fundamentally kind. In return for support and affection, Kate was a most loyal friend, going to great trouble to stay in touch, to help and advise, to listen and share joys and sorrows. Her correspondents were legion. Her friendships knew no snobbery, although she could be a thorough snob when she chose. Our maids, the Englishwoman in Binghamton who sewed for her, the Spanish stone mason who built the beautiful retaining walls for the Santa Fe house: all these people and many, many more had warm personal relationships with Kate that lasted for years, just as much as famous musicians or German industrialists whom she also counted among her friends. She enjoyed the admiration of an unusually large circle of friends, and could—quite frequently! —make her children roll their eyes as she feigned surprise at some gesture of devotion from one of her numerous champions.</p>
            
                                <p>Kate was cheerful and pleasant in her speech. The atmosphere she created helped others create an extraordinary quality of interaction; it was invigorating and fun. Her parties were almost always highly successful, and very few people turned down her invitations. Her avidity for “interesting” people, and her nose for talent, led her to discover outstanding people in the most unlikely places. Moving from Munich and Salzburg, where she knew “everybody,” to provincial Binghamton cannot have been the easiest thing in the world, yet Kate’s pleasure in people remained genuine. While she could be sharply critical, particularly of laziness and cowardice, she never seemed to tire of people’s idiosyncrasies, and had a broad interest in human endeavors. She was kind, as mentioned before. She did not take advantage of people; she wanted them to shine. It pleased her particularly if they chose to shine in her orbit, but if not, she did not pursue them much, or resent their independence. One other quality distinguished our mother: she never in her life felt out of her depth. The fact that she was a beauty no doubt contributed to that self-confidence. Her physical allure was palpable, and she was well aware of it.</p>
            
                                <p>All of these qualities were present, though not fully developed, in the nineteen-year-old girl who arrived in Munich in August of 1918, looking forward to a vacation and new experiences. How Kate came to be in Munich in the last summer of World War I, I do not know. She said that she simply decided that she had to see Munich – <em>“ich habe es mir in den Kopf gesetzt”</em> (I got it into my head). She brought her bicycle on the train from Schwerin, and somewhere in the picture there was a friend, someone with whom Kate stayed. The two young women spent time together sightseeing, and one day a visit to a poor wounded soldier was on the itinerary. Kate was reluctant to accompany her friend — why would a nineteen-year-old want to go to a hospital to see a strange soldier? But go she did, and that fateful visit changed Willi and Kate’s lives forever.</p>
                                 
                                <p>In their letters there are equally stunned references to the overwhelming impact, the bolt of lightning that struck them both. It is easy to comprehend Willi’s enchantment with Kate. Her physical grace was striking, she arrived with a bouquet of wildflowers, and I can well picture the look of perfect concentration and kindness she bestowed on Willi. It entranced many a less vulnerable person than Willi on his sickbed that day. Her easy ways, her friendly chatter, her joy in life must have been a tonic for him. But what did she see in him? Sitting up in bed in his hospital outfit he could not, one would think, have made in the Italian phrase a <em>bella figura,</em> so it must have been his face that cast a spell on Kate, his eyes, the windows of his soul, and his talk. Kate had been a great flirt in her school years. She had been born a flirt and would continue to flirt till the day she died. But this encounter left her moved to her innermost being, as it did Willi.</p>
            
                                <p>There must have been several visits before Kate returned to Schwerin in September. They must have talked for hours, to judge by the range of their knowledge of each other as reflected in Willi’s earliest letters. Happiness filled their beings, love had come to them in a miraculous fashion. Kate began the correspondence by sending Willi a postcard and some photographs of herself taken on a sightseeing trip to southern Bavaria. Willi hid them in the book he was reading to keep them from curious eyes. On August 29, 1918, nine days after they met, Willi wrote a love poem to Kate:</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first"><em>Lasst mich leben</em></p>
                                <p class="inset"><em>Ihr Götter, der ich euch eben</em></p>
                                <p class="inset"><em>Leib und Seele noch willig hingegeben.</em></p>
                                <p class="inset"><em>Mit allen Trieben</em></p>
                                <p class="inset"><em>Des Herzens zieht mich’s zu ihr:</em></p>
                                <p class="inset last"><em>Ach, lasst mich leben und lieben!</em></p>
            
                                <p class="inset">Let me live,</p>
                                <p class="inset">Ye Gods, whom a moment ago</p>
                                <p class="inset">I offered my life and my soul, willingly.</p>
                                <p class="inset">All the impulses of my heart</p>
                                <p class="inset">Yearn for her.</p>
                                <p class="inset last">Oh let me live and love!</p>
            
                                <p>Letters began to fly back and forth between Munich and Schwerin. I wish more of Kate’s had been saved. As it is, we have to extrapolate them from Willi’s replies. There are imagined kisses and embraces. Evenings before sleep they have set aside for being with each other in spirit. On November 1, he discusses All Saints’s Day and All Souls: he is young—and probably hungry—enough to give a loving, longing description of a yeast cake that used to be part of All Souls’ before the war, the <em>Seelenzopf,</em> the Souls’ Braid, that he can now only dream of. That is also the day when Kate begins to save Willi’s letters. On November 19, 1918, less than three weeks after the Armistice, Willi writes,</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">I am so glad now that I was not killed…A huge responsibility rests on the shoulders of those who came home alive—may they never forget it. You poor darling wept for the dead…I felt that way so deeply for a time that I did not want to live. You know about that, and know who saved me from that, my good, gentle savior. A joyous rebirth in you. You always shine for me, even when you are melancholy and have reason to be.</p>
            
                                <p>When Kate appeared in Willi’s room in August, 1918, the Great War was still dragging on, with continued horrifying losses on both sides. Willi was very slowly recuperating from his wound. Shrapnel had lodged in his belly close to the spine, too close for a safe operation to remove it. In the course of several operations bits of shell that worked their way to the surface were removed. The process had to be repeated until 1923, thirteen operations in all, each filled with intense pain.</p>
            
                                <p>The day before Armistice Day, Willi’s natural optimism led him to write, </p>
            
                                <p class="inset first">What do we have to fear despite all our sorrows, with the knowledge of love in our hearts? We are sure of each other, no matter what collapse may occur. There is a nice old Latin saying, ‘Though the world may shatter, we shall stand undaunted upon the ruins.’ It’s by the same Horace who said, ‘I hate the common rabble and keep at a distance.’</p>
            
                                <p>Willi adds that these sayings make a harmonious whole! Did he imagine that Kate could manage to remain untouched by their surroundings?</p>
            
                                <p>On November 11, he writes to Kate that the terms of the German surrender have so shattered him that he feels he could lose his mind: “The conditions are the equivalent of our total destruction.” But, on the other hand, his doctor examined him and was very satisfied. Willi hopes to be able to resume his studies: “Perhaps I can prevail on the new Soldiers’ Council. <em>Speriamo</em> [let’s hope]. That sounds so strangely empty and ridiculously impossible, that word hope. And yet, the mighty little goddess sits hidden in a corner of the heart—she won’t give up.” Right at that point Willi apparently received a telegram from Kate, happy at the resumption of normal relations with Bavaria. “Hurrah, darling,” he exclaims, and goes on to say, “Anyone who had not known of developments here would have noticed nothing. It really all went splendidly... <em>Addio</em> for today, my dearest little one. Be merry and well!”</p>
            
                                <p>This was the time of the Räterepublik in Bavaria, a republic based on soldiers’ and peasants’ councils. Willi looked at current politics with some skepticism, but writes on November 13: “For us in Bavaria the new republic is a piece of luck, if for no other reason than that it may stem the reign of the clerics a bit, and that partly — completely is out of the question when you consider the immense power Catholicism has over Bavarian souls — freer, less oppressive and more rational views will be endorsed.” On November 27, he adds:</p>
                                 
                                <p class="inset first last">Bavarians are still under the influence of the priests, who are trying by all possible means not to lose their dominion. We are all democratically inclined... I believe that Eisner and his friends will withdraw again. They are probably too smart not to know that they cannot possibly retain power over a Catholic people that is so easily roused to anti-semitism. [All government officials in the <em>Räterepublik</em> were Jewish.] Even the greatest enemies of the Jews hereabouts — I have some stone-blindly conservative acquaintances — admit, through gnashed teeth, that the Jews have more intelligence, diligence and energy than they themselves. Darling, when I hear these complaints about the Jews, I keep quite still, try hard not to burst out laughing, and at most come out with some sarcastic remark (that envy must be a very Christian attribute, why didn’t they show some ambition themselves, etc.), at which point I am regularly told of the frightful power of cohesion, of sticking together. That they themselves cannot manage it puzzles them greatly.</p>
            
                                <p>As the fact that Kate was only half Jewish probably did not emerge until 1920, it is illuminating to examine Willi’s comments on Jews in his letters from 1918 to 1921. He certainly considered himself free of anti-semitism. His best friend, Walter Jablonski, was a Jew. As far as he knew Kate was a Jew. Trude Hirsch, an outstanding violinist whom he admired, was Jewish, and admiration of Jews in general is expressed in the letter just cited. And yet, Willi felt free to criticize “average” Jews. On July 2, 1919, he writes:</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">It is true that you are Jewish. Strangely, you have none of the many qualities that instinctively strike us as unpleasant in average Jews. I intentionally say many, for you know yourself that purely from an esthetic point of view much in the conduct and mode of life of the average Jew is objectionable. It’s not as if that were not true of many Christians etc., but among a cohesive group and a society within a society it is more especially noticeable. You darling must not be grieved by something that, in the last analysis, is so rooted and anchored in the evolution of things that it cannot be altered at one stroke, and it may not change for centuries. We for our part at least will work to make it different. In the process of changing, there will have to be compromises, and the Jews will have to change and adapt as much as those who despise them.</p>
            
                                <p>Willi felt free to say that much of the “average” Jew’s conduct was objectionable, but his reaction to the family of his friend Jablonski sounds a very different note. The Jablonskis lived on Fasanenstrasse, where Berlin’s main synagogue was. </p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">The household is first class, the apartment furnished with assured elegance and lavishness. I get my egg in the morning along with everyone else, and they are so charming about it that one is not oppressed [presumably by their generosity in that time of severe shortages of food]. The father is more like a scholar than a businessman. Walter works at the <em>Charité</em> (Hospital) ….The mother seems young, and there are two sisters and a little brother...</p>
            
                                <p>On Whitsunday, Willi reports: “You cannot imagine how well Walter Jablonski manages to live by shutting out the Berlin that we hate. I’ve experienced only beauty, as if ugliness did not exist. This morning we’ve been sitting in the sun, smelling the lilies of the valley and sweet peas, reading a few verses of Catullus, and all that after festive coffee and coffeecake.” Willi and Jablonski read aloud to each other: Baudelaire, Stefan George, Jean Paul, the sixth chapter of the Odyssey (Nausicaa) and “a little Italian—Petrarch and a modern writer, Pascoli.” So that makes French, German, Greek, Italian and, with the Catullus previously mentioned, Latin. When they go to the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Willi says: “I am most blissful with my old Italians, and then also Rembrandt. The riches of these museums are quite astonishing….We went to the Egyptian department. There are things there so unfathomably beautiful that it makes you forget the world.” At the National Gallery, Willi was especially taken with Cezanne.</p>
            
                                <p>On Friday, June 13, 1919, Willi, too superstitious to travel back to Munich on such an unlucky date, went for a walk at Sans Souci, Frederick the Great’s castle. “You were always with me,” he tells Kate. “I am like you in that I so much love this refined architectural tradition, and the gardens.” The ten-day stay with the Jablonskis appears to represent Willi’s ideal life: a sort of Arcadian existence, filled with physical and intellectual beauty, enjoyed at leisure. In his thank-you note he writes: “It was so wonderful to stay with you, and my life with you so exceptional, that it takes some effort to fit oneself back into daily life.” </p>
            
                                <p>Kate writes charmingly at one point: “By the way, I discovered today that Munich lies exactly south of Schwerin on the same degree of longitude (or what was it called in geography lessons?) You see, the Lord had the best of intentions and didn’t want to make things hard for us: all we have to do is let ourselves glide.” She seems to be in charge of the care of Adolf Tietz who is suffering from some unspecified ailment of which Willi says that it is “burdensome and agonizing for him—and the smoking on top of it!’ Her spirits rarely falter, but Willi complains: “As sorry as I am for him, you, beloved, have to bear the greatest burden and bear it completely alone, and you do it all as a matter of course. Things that are damned well the duty and obligation of your brothers weigh you down, and there is no one to help you. One is proud and unhappy at the same time when one thinks of you.” Hedwig Tietz suffered from asthma, so Kate had to administer her medication. Even their vacation was left up to Kate. In 1919, just after her twentieth birthday, she made all the inquiries and arrangements for her parents. Kate was by far the most energetic, vital member of her family. She felt an obligation to be available to them, and they did not hesitate to lean on her.</p>
            
                                <p>During the height of the unrest, in March and April 1919, no mail came or went from Munich, and the two were quite cut off from each other. Kate was the more distressed because press reports of events in Munich sounded alarming. Yet her high spirits come through: “You, darling, do you really know that you absolutely have to come soon? Otherwise at least send me some warm spring as a warm messenger... I have no letter from you today, and I am waiting for news in these hard days with a pounding heart.”<span class="citation">39</span></p>
            
                                <p>A few weeks later, just before Willi came to Schwerin, she writes,</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">The last words in your telegram yesterday had me beside myself. You said, ‘just have a little more patience’ —oh darling, Moses could not have listened with more attention on Sinai, or Mary to the annunciation, than I listened to that! If you tell me that it’s just a matter of a little patience —since you really are not a hand-picked representative of that virtue, right?—it can’t be long any more, and I woke up at night with an overwhelming feeling of happiness.</p>
            
                                <p>By his presence in Schwerin in May 1919, Willi succeeded in persuading Kate’s mother of his worthiness as a suitor. When Kate anxiously asked her mother what she thought of Willi, Hedwig Tietz answered, <em>“Kind, Du hast mit Gott geredet”</em> (“Child, you must have spoken straight to God”).</p>
            
                                <p>On April 3, Kate went off to Berlin to attend the engagement party of her cousin Alice (perhaps a second cousin; the relationship is not clear.) Kate had an “incredibly large family in Berlin” and stayed in a hotel with her Hamburg aunt, Liese, who is “very kind and clever” but also very irresolute. Having changed her mind several times about which train she would take from Hamburg to Berlin to meet up with Kate, she, “called from Hamburg for absolutely the last time as she solemnly assured me, and of course she is taking a different train, one to which I have no connection.”</p>
            
                                <p>The engagement party in Berlin was somewhat abbreviated by the threat of a general strike, which “didn’t come after all. So it is a shame that these holidays came to such a discordant end, because everyone scattered in all directions in greatest fear. On Tuesday, cars with mounted machine guns were driving through the streets everywhere to ‘calm the populace.’ It did anything but calm me, and I can imagine that such a ‘safety measure’ could make peaceful, innocent people quite nervous.”<span class="citation">40</span></p>
            
                                <p>On April 8 she was back in Schwerin, and writes to Willi for his twenty-fourth birthday: “I hardly know what to wish for you...let me tell you that my heart implores the best for you, the very best, my dear love...Celebrate the 12th in your own fashion, and whatever part of me will make you joyful I give you—oh yes, and how gladly. I love you. Your Kate.” She also comments that the issue of April 8 of the Berlin Zeitung am Mittag, “looked at events in Munich with a little bit of humor. Wasn’t that just about as justified as the attitude of the big merchant members of my family who were frightened out of their wits yesterday, and looked at the future without hope?”<span class="citation">41</span> One can only trust that that future without hope motivated those big merchants to leave Germany in time, a dozen or so years later: how right they were to be frightened.</p>
            
            
                                <div class="rest"> </div>
            
                                <p>This is perhaps the proper occasion to talk about Kate’s turning her back on her Jewish past as time went on. While she spoke lovingly of her mother and her uncle Max Pinner, we never once heard a single story of her attending services at the synagogue, or any other indication of her Jewishness. While I became aware in 1945 or 1946 that the Bohms, her Hamburg relatives, had been released from Theresienstadt, at the time we met their boat in New York I was still only vaguely conscious of the gassing of Europe’s entire Jewish population. The camps were never discussed in our family. Once I went to work for the U.S. Army’s Civilian Censorship Division in Munich in 1946, I, of course, found out about the nature of the camps. I was young and irresponsible, but I wrote home about my friend Al Solnit, a doctor who worked in a Displaced Persons Camp, and about my colleagues in CCD, of whom most, like me, were refugees. That was one of those things: Hoerlin and my mother insisted that we were not refugees: we were immigrants. My mother deplored the fact that most of my colleagues were Jewish. </p>
            
                                <p>After the end of the war, CARE packages in their hundreds had made their way from our house in Binghamton to Germany, going to German relatives and friends. It is true that Germans also needed help after the war. In 1944, our beloved uncle, Walter Schmid, had been drafted into the <em>Volkssturm</em>, a military force made up of older men and boys. He was killed in Czechoslovakia in 1945, by Ukrainian soldiers who had fought on the side of the Nazis, and wanted no witnesses to their treachery. Tante Toni was in dire straits because, until Uncle Walter could be proven dead, she received no pension. She kept herself and Willi above water by giving piano lessons. My cousin Wolfi had been captured by American troops and was all right. My cousin Walter had also been captured by American troops and been sent home. He wanted to study medicine. Uncle Franz Ringler, and Elli and Irmi, could also very much use a helping hand, especially because Franz began to suffer from cancer. Everyone needed help, and Kate and Hoerlin obliged with countless CARE packages.</p>
            
                                <p>In the meantime relations with Kate’s half-brother Fredi, who had emigrated to New York, helped substantively by Kate, had been thorny since 1935. They deteriorated further once Kate was in Binghamton. Kate had helped Fredi with obtaining a machine he needed for his medical office, and enlisted Bettina Warburg’s help and advice when Fredi came down with cancer, but Kate and Fredi’s wife Elsie were fundamentally incompatible. Elsie’s feelings ran so high that Kate was not notified when Fredi died, I believe in the early 1950s, nor was she invited to the funeral.</p>
            
                                <p>While one must make some allowance for the very different attitude that prevailed toward ethnic slurs in Europe as well as in America in the late 19th and early 20th century, German anti-semitism was intertwined with anti-Enlightenment attitudes rooted in blood-and-soil notions of the German <em>Volk</em> as a unique, almost religious identity. These völkische preoccupations cannot be dignified as being ideas, they are literally notions: absurd conceptions about the German soul, its special relation to the German landscape, the purity of the fictitious Aryan race, and its fervent attachment to pre-Christian, archaic Germanic “traditions” long lost in a mist-shrouded forest. Various <em>völkisch</em> believers added on details, but common to almost all of this thinking was a deep distrust of Jews that in many cases became hatred.</p>
            
                                <p>When in 1919 Kate complained about the abysmal treatment of Rostock’s Jewish students by the Burschenschaft student associations, that is the least of it. German Jews had been emancipated in the 18th century, during the Enlightenment. After centuries of oppression, civil rights had been extended to them. Before that, the famous philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix von Mendelssohn’s grandfather, coming to Berlin from Dessau in 1743, was made to walk around the entire city to enter by the Rosenthaler Tor, the gate set aside for Jews and cattle.</p>
            
                                <p>From the first, Jewish emancipation had been supported because it was thought it might be able to make Jews shed their Judaism, and with it their undesirable qualities. Johann Christian Dohm, the champion of emancipation, hoped that through it, Jews would repudiate their past, become “ethical persons” [!] and settle down to “honest work,” as he wrote in his 1783 statement, <em>“Über die Bürgerliche Verbesserung des Juden”</em> (Concerning the Civil Betterment of the Jews). The Germans were not alone in their paranoia. The Frenchman Gobineau agreed with the superiority of some races over others in his <em>Essai sur l’Inégalité des Races Humaines,</em> and so did Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Wagner’s son-in-law, who had his eye on a more racially pure future.</p>
                                 
                                <p>Wagner himself and his Bayreuth circle were vociferous anti-Semites. By the 1880s large numbers of Eastern Jews, escaping the ghettos and Tsarist conscription, began to emigrate to the new German Reich, established in 1871. They were often highly competitive, because their disadvantages had been such that extreme competitiveness was a way of surviving. A typical German reaction was that German-born Jews might be able to assimilate, but aliens could not.</p>
            
                                <p>The one and only time I recall Kate’s acknowledging the suffering of the Jews occurred in the summer of 1983, when Kate and Hoerlin had moved to Carleton-Willard Village, a retirement home in Bedford, Massachusetts. Kate was visiting me in my house on Prospect Street in Newburyport and having problems, as she often did by then, with her bowels. I was with her in the bathroom, trying to help her, and she said, to my vast surprise, “Thank you for your help, Dusch. Nobody helped those poor people in the camps.” We got distracted, nothing further was said — how I wish we had talked about it more.</p>
            
                                <p>The increasing anti-Semitism exhibited both by Hoerlin and Kate in their old age was anathema to us children. I remember Bettina so upset by Hoerlin’s remarks during one visit that she told him that if he did not stop his comments, she would take Jason and Noah, whose father was Jewish, and leave for home. I cannot recall what brought on my furious reply to an episode during which Kate denigrated the Jews, but I remember using Bethe, Eva Feuermann Lehnsen, and Wolfskehl as examples of “really terrible people—stupid and unkind, right?” It stopped her in her tracks. I could have thought of many additional people if she wanted a list, among them Sumner Yaffe, at that time Bettina’s husband, who was exceedingly kind and helpful to Kate and Hoerlin.</p>
            
                                <p>There were other difficulties for Willi and Kate. One of the most trying was their financial problems. The war years had caused a long hiatus in Willi’s education. He had barely begun college, and faced years of study before he could expect to earn a living. He had also, romantically, conceived of his future as that of a musician or a scholar. Both choices involved long preparation, and very little immediate earning power. Willi’s parents could not give much financial assistance. Kate’s family had no money to spare after the war. She was too young and inexperienced to have much prospect of remunerative employment, even had there been no social pressure on a middle-class bride not to work.</p>
            
                                <p>The financial pressures were the first that Willi and Kate tackled. He committed to an emergency teacher-training course. This would permit him to earn a frugal (very frugal!) living, and, more importantly, would be an <em>entrée</em> into the German civil service. All teachers were civil servants, and it could be a lifetime career. A pension was part of the picture. Kate intended to become a pediatric nurse. She loved children and would enroll in a training course at a hospital. The proposed hospital was, of course, in Munich.</p>
            
                                <p>But there was a far more serious barrier to surmount. While Willi was courting Kate, he had expressed indifference to Christianity. After visiting the Isenheimer Altar, Grunewald’s famous triptych, he said that: “one would have to be a Christian [to be able to appreciate it fully], which I am not.”<span class="citation">42</span> There is no reference to Sunday mass, except at Easter or Christmas. He does display apprehension about Kate’s Jewish family considering him a poor choice as a non-Jew. In fact, when Tante Liese of Hamburg gets wind of Kate’s interest in Willi, she warns Hedwig of the unsuitability of a Bavarian Catholic as the husband of a Jewish girl. We have no record of what Reta Schmid, on the other end, thought of her eldest, the pride of the Schmids, becoming more and more intimate with a <em>Juedin</em> (a Jewess), as they would surely have called Kate.</p>
            
                                <p>In the spring of 1921, after more than two years of courtship, Willi and Kate had finally overcome all family opposition. The young couple’s prospects appeared rosy. And here came another thunderclap: on February 10, 1921, Willi discovered that a Catholic ceremony could only be performed between Christians. If he were not married in a Catholic ceremony, he automatically would secede from the Catholic church, and if he did that, he could not be a civil servant in Bavaria. On February 15, 1921, he writes: </p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">Whether I was Protestant or Catholic, I could not marry anyone who does not belong to one of these two communities. In my first fury about this unheard-of idiocy I spoke with the school inspector, who also said that I have to be very careful, because just the other day a teacher who left the Catholic Church was immediately dismissed from the civil service. I would never even have thought of something like that, and it was a great blow to my unsuspecting ignorance. It’s not as if I felt an absolutely compelling need to secede from Catholicism, but to find that it is impossible to do so because otherwise I lose my livelihood, that I consider an outrage, and so low as to smack of the selling of souls. Only for that reason do I wish for an American million, so I could fling the whole mess in perfect independence before the feet...of the ministries and governments.</p>
            
                                <p>What to do? The initial solution Willi came up with was that he would become a Protestant. But if he did that, his chances of getting a teaching job in Munich would be remote, because there was little need in Munich for Protestant teachers, since all schools in Bavaria were segregated by confession, and we know that the population was overwhelmingly Catholic. His letter concludes with a reflection on how horrible it is to be a Bavarian civil servant (February 10, 1921). Kate, in response, apparently offered to convert. Willi answered that while it was easy, “more or less natural,” to leave a religion, converting carried all sorts of unpleasantness with it. Kate would have a choice between Catholicism and Protestantism. The latter leaves much more free choice, while Catholicism has many moral obligations, and rules and regulations, “which are terrible for a convert...without a magnanimous, intelligent instructor it must be atrocious...There’s dogma in every religion, but without a doubt, it is most developed and entails the greatest demands in the case of the orthodox Jews and the Catholics.”<span class="citation">43</span> Willi suspects that “the two of us probably have no idea what impediments, troubles, even strife and battles, may result” within Kate’s family concerning her conversion. Willi thought it best to table all further discussion of this unexpectedly horrendous obstacle until they were together.</p>
            
                                <p>Willi’s apparently total surprise at the inflexibility of the Catholic Church in matters of intermarriage reflects the extent to which Bavarian Catholics were encapsulated in their own world, a world the church ruled with an iron hand. Willi had commented on the absolute power with which the priests ruled the faithful—he just had not been aware that this iron rule also held him in thrall. The prospect of Kate’s becoming a Catholic was not half as horrifying to him as to his bride. “I hate Catholicism,” she apparently wrote. Willi asks her in his letter of February 20, 1921, “How can you hate Catholicism when you don’t know anything about it?”</p>
            
                                <p>There might have been long and difficult negotiations between the couple, but on March 17, 1921, Willi had an emergency operation for an abdominal rupture, which, once again, was almost the end of him. A little scrap of a note has survived, in handwriting unrecognizable as his, in which he begs Kate to come immediately: “Dearest Heart, I will tell you the truth quite openly: I was operated on today...I would be blissfully happy if you could come right now. Will it be very hard for your dearest mother and your kind father to do without you? I beg all of you most sincerely for it.” Kate came, and they were able to discuss face to face all the hindrances confronting them.</p>
            
                                <p>Kate stayed in Munich for eight weeks, and probably began her religious instruction in preparation for conversion during that stay. By early May, Willi mentions “the night in Ettal,” the Benedictine abbey to which Willi would become formally attached as an acolyte in 1926. He also refers to “the hour in Dörfler’s chapel.” Peter Dörfler (1878-1955) was a Catholic priest, and a well-known writer of regional fiction. Most likely, he was Kate’s religious instructor, and a more magnanimous, intelligent instructor would have been hard to find. Willi and Kate hoped that he would perform their marriage, but the date that was determined in the end fell into Dörfler’s vacation, so that did not come about. Peter Dörfler remained a close family friend, a person in whom, after Willi’s death, Kate could confide and a benign presence to us children. In the fall of 1934 Kate was to write to Hoerlin concerning Dörfler, “Everything that has meaning and value beyond the passing day is palpable and present with him.”</p>
            
                                <p>One of the things that Willi was quite aware of was how much each of them was giving up to make a marriage possible. Kate, “a relatively carefree life, full as can be of cheerful enjoyment, and more: your habitual home and surroundings, more: your family, your mother, and religion, and race,” and he, “his music, his scholarly studies without regard to livelihood, the library needed for that... all that will be mine in more modest measure, as a ‘dilettante’.” But his consideration of these matters was merrily replaced by thinking about their engagement announcement appearing in the Berliner Tageblatt that day, May 28, 1921: “Charming thought how everyone will pity you: ‘that man!,’ ‘no title!,’ ‘a Christian!,’ ‘how on earth did she settle on him?,’ ‘I simply don’t understand the parents!’ And, ‘that in this family, a Tietz daughter!’”</p>
            
                                <p>Kate wrote about her new life, and Willi’s reply on May 30, 1921, gives an intimation of her tone of voice: “Your last letter is filled with [joy]. I am so hopeful, you dear love. And I thank you…for thinking of us here, and of all the beginnings that your conversion has brought. —The more I submerge myself in Don Bosco [the subject of his thesis], the greater the old, accustomed, traditional Catholicism becomes for me.”</p>
            
                                <p>On June 21, 1921, Willi considers that school will start again on September 1, </p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">[...]so we are granted a short honeymoon only. Therefore it will have to be infinitely tranquil and significant, won’t it? I am burning with consuming impatience to be with you and to begin our common life. More and more I sense how fortunate and how wealthy we are in each other, and must increasingly become. I feel that I am one of those who are given a greatly blessed existence. I become aware of life’s immeasurable riches, how a ring forms of wife, nature, art and knowledge, to make a rapturous circle. I must thank you for yourself forever. I wish you a good and quiet night, I submerse myself entirely in you, and dream of everything that has been and everything that will be. Full of kisses of love for you, wholly, totally your Willi.</p>
            
                                <p>By 1921 Kate and Willi had dreamed of marriage for two and a half years. They had been together less than twenty weeks of that protracted time. They were both passionately in love, and they were sensual people. It is not possible to arrive at a definite conclusion about whether they had slept with one another or not, but they certainly embraced with deep passion. They write of their kisses, Willi writes of Kate’s beautiful breast which he glimpsed once on “their” island in the lake of Schwerin, of her loosened hair, of her soft breathing in her sleep. They were both burning with love, and driven to distraction by their frequent and long separations.</p>
            
                                <p>Willi shows impressive concern for the feelings of his parents, and especially also of Hedwig Tietz. He tries to make sure that in their longing for each other, he and Kate do not entirely disregard the old folks’ sensibilities. The tempestuous love the two felt was bounded by their respectful regard for their parents. But how grateful they were when they finally won Hedwig over completely, and the Schmids, too. Reta, I believe, was still a little hesitant about Kate, but what sort of perfection would a girl have had to display to be good enough for her idolized eldest?</p>
            
                                <p>The preparations for the wedding must have been exceedingly stressful. Adolf Tietz, who would not attend the wedding because of ill health, eliminated by his absence the greatest stumbling block, since he was never to learn anything about Kate’s conversion. Her mother was the only member of Kate’s family who knew the truth, and would attend the sacramental vows. (Since it is possible that Fredi attended the wedding, as I suspect that he is shown at the left of the front row on the eve of the wedding, it could be that he was also privy to Kate’s conversion, but that is speculation.) I do not, in fact, know how it finally went. There was a wide choice! On June 26, Willi writes: “[I thought] we’ll get married at the registry office at the Petersbergl after all… Or we could be married in the little church in the Buttermelcherstrasse, the so-called Klösterl…” On July 4, he reconsiders: “After all now I favor Allach, because of the publicity, although the village Church is very tiny…I’ll go out to Allach tomorrow and go over everything in person.”</p>
            
                                <p>In the midst of the preparations he makes an important announcement, on July 5, 1921: ”Wait—one more joy: my gamba will be ready on Thursday, after exactly two years. I can practice a little, so that then I can play for you.” On July 12, 1921, he writes Kate regarding her parting from home: “Your parting from home is also hard for me, but in my deepest heart dwells my interest in making your life as happy as you have made mine, by the fact of your existence and by your love. You know that at the beginning, and probably for years to come, our style of living will be outwardly very modest. But in exchange for that we will have something that only a few people have, and on which the two of us can pride ourselves without vanity, our love, which is not commonplace and not average, and which has everything: passion and humility, pride and devotion, which spans body and soul, and will lead us to perfect unity...I cannot yet grasp what it will mean to be able to call you completely and forever my wife, to be your husband for all the days of my life.”</p>
            
                                <p>It is likely that they had their quiet wedding in the Allach church. Walter played the organ and Elli sang, and guests, other than the Schmid parents and Hedwig Tietz, only witnessed the civil ceremony later in the day. In the picture of the wedding party the night before the wedding, I only know nine or ten of the twenty-four participants. Kate looks beautiful, Willi content. There had also been much discussion about the reception, where it should be held and what should be served, so as not to waste too much money. Money was the final problem that faced the couple and their families, “the cursed, despised issue of money,” as Willi said. Times in Germany were still dreadful. Few families had as much to eat as they wanted, and there were shortages of fuel as well as food. How would they manage on a teacher’s salary? Kate had been more hesitant than Willi, wondering how to make ends meet. Willi, the optimist and dreamer, said, “We must be able to do it. We just need to want to enough.” He proposed earning extra money through tutoring, through giving music lessons, through playing chamber music in smaller cities, and through accepting gigs in pick-up orchestras.</p>
            
                                <p>But all those worries were left behind as Willi and Kate went off to the Sulgers’ house next to Nymphenburg Park. They had been offered the Sulgers’ villa, since the Sulgers would be on vacation. It was an enchanting place to begin their marriage. They spent many hours in the glorious park, and no one knew where they were. Cards thanking participants for their gifts and good wishes went out, but Willi and Kate stayed hidden for almost a month of bliss. The Sulgers gave them a beautiful edition of Goethe’s Complete Works, an Insel edition printed in 1920. The dedication said “To Kate and Willi Schmid, with many good wedding wishes, and in permanent remembrance of their ‘wedding journey’ to Casa Regina, from Regina and Emil Sulger-Gebing, September 1921.” I still have it.</p>
            
                                <p>Their happy honeymoon was the beginning of an unusually happy, fulfilling marriage, though it lasted barely thirteen years. There is ample evidence of the love between Kate and Willi. In the beginning they lived in a tiny apartment where Kate did all the housework without the help of a maid. Willi was out of the house from 6:30 am to 8:00 pm, giving lessons, teaching, playing music. He was as good as his word, and worked as hard as he could. </p>
            
                                <p>In 1924 he resigned from teaching, confident that he could earn enough from criticism and music-making to make their life feasible. In the meantime, the Schmids had made a lot of friends. Among them were a number of notable people, too mature to have found a natural affinity with people so much younger. I suppose they were attracted to them by their charm, knowledge, and great curiosity. One who doted on them was Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), a controversial but exceedingly erudite scholar whom Kate had discovered at a masked ball, during Fasching. Fasching is the Bavarian version of Mardi Gras, a time when life in Munich used to come to pretty much of a halt. Everyone took part in it, and some of its masked balls are famous for their extravagant spectacles. Kate had come home in the early hours of the morning (as had Willi, from a different venue) with a strange man, saying, “Look what I discovered at the ball!” The strange man she had “discovered” turned out to be Oswald Spengler. </p>
            
                                <p>It was Spengler’s learnedness that intrigued the young couple, and the fact that this already famous man found them worth knowing must have been flattering, too, although neither Willi nor Kate were greatly awed by fame. Kate especially had a childlike certainty that people would, of course, like her at the very least, and with any luck at all be enchanted by her. Spengler became almost a member of the family. When Kate was pregnant with Thomi, she and Spengler took two-year-old me on an outing to the Isartal, and mulled over names for the coming baby. It is an indication of the nearly absolute disregard of my given name that Spengler had ‘Renate’ on his list for the new child. Spengler was a staunch friend to Kate after Willi’s death, because he had admired Willi’s rootedness in Bavarian landscape, religion and tradition.</p>
            
                                <p>Another forceful personality for whom Willi and Kate constituted “a reason for remaining in Munich” was the poet Karl Wolfskehl (1869–1948). His Jewish family had roots in the Rhineland going back a thousand years. He had a great library, something that of course acted like a magnet for Willi. I remember him with much affection. He was a romantic, amazing figure, full of charm and joyousness, and unusually kind to children. He really looked at us, talked with us, was unlike many German adults in his patient respect for us. After Willi’s death, when the Nazis increasingly threatened Jewish life in Germany, he sold his beloved, enormous library in exchange for a life pension from the buyer. He emigrated to New Zealand, and in contrast to many refugees who found a great deal to criticize in their new homelands, Wolfskehl, in his middle sixties, embraced English and its literature with remarkable energy and determined affirmation.</p>
            
                                <p>Two other close friends were the Haniels. Karl Haniel was the managing director of the <em>MNN</em>, a pleasant, liberal Rhinelander. Curt Haniel, his cousin, and his wife Hedi, became close friends of the Schmids, joining them in the mountains, and in the pursuit of architectural and artistic treasures. The Haniels almost certainly helped with Willi’s funeral expenditures, as there was no insurance (Willi had been refused because of his war wounds), and no savings. The bank in which Willi and Kate had had a small savings account had gone bankrupt in the depression. </p>
            
                                <p>Another Munich friend was Oswald Bumke, a psychiatrist. Slightly older than the Schmids, he was remarkable for his opposition to attempts at euthanasia which were prevalent in the early ‘30s. When a law on voluntary sterilization was being discussed in the Prussian provincial health council, Bumke wrote, “if one were to drag the discussion of sterilization into today’s arena of political struggle, one would probably pretty soon hear less talk about the mentally ill, but more regarding Aryans and non-Aryans, and of the blond Germanic race and the less valuable round-skulls. It is certainly unlikely that anything positive would arise from this; on the contrary, both science in general, and genealogy and eugenics in particular, would be damaged in ways from which they would not easily recover.’ [He also warned of the view that] . . . ‘we must not merely kill all of the mentally ill and psychopaths, but every cripple, including wounded war veterans, all the old maids who are no longer working, all the widows who no longer have children to raise, and all the invalids and old age pensioners.’” <span class="citation">44</span> Bumke was thus well aware of the connection between killing “worthless” citizens and the eventual elimination of the Jews. His brother, who was the chief justice of the German supreme court, had a very different point of view, and as a consequence committed suicide in 1945.</p>
            
                                <p>There was also Paul Reusch, a Ruhr industrialist who, although quite conservative, was anti-Nazi because of snobbery and patriotism — how could such rabble govern Germany? His wealth and prominent place among wheelers and dealers made him an unlikely friend of the Schmids, but he was kindly disposed toward them. After Willi’s death he helped Kate with advice, and possibly with some money. Among Reusch’s friends was Max Warburg, the Hamburg banker, and his relative, Mrs. Paul Warburg, Nina, to whom he sent Kate on her visit to New York in 1938. Kate made such a good impression on Nina Warburg that they became friends at first meeting, and she and her daughter Bettina, the psychiatrist already mentioned, stayed our friends for life.</p>
            
                                <p>There is no doubt that Onkel Hans was Kate’s most important helper after Willi was killed, and after her mother died three weeks later, in July 1934. You will recall that the Schmid grandparents had died within the year. Poor Kate, her entire support system was wiped out within ten months. Hans was her truest, staunchest remaining friend and confidant. Onkel Hans was also the person who started Kate on the use of narcotics to help her sleep. A more polite name for these medications was, of course, sleeping pills. Who could blame the victim of a tragedy like Willi’s death for seeking oblivion at least during the nights? Hans did not foresee that in her old age Kate would be addicted to these drugs.</p>

                                <div id="loadSeven"></div>
            
                                <p>Kate spent her days seeking a pension from the German state to compensate her and us three children for the loss of the breadwinner, who had been illegally taken and murdered without mercy, in what was then still seen to be a legitimate nation in the European tradition. Kate methodically pursued her rights to compensation from this nation—not, as has sometimes been mistakenly said, from the SS, nor from the Nazi party. It took more than a year, but finally, on September 14, 1935, Kate received notification from the Reich Secretary of the Interior that her pension would be paid from Reich funds and deposited to her account by the German Treasury Department.</p>
            
                                <p>During the long, anxiety-provoking time of waiting for this decision, Kate was also preparing the collection of Willi’s writings that would make up the <em>Unvollendete Symphonie</em> (Unfinished Symphony). The speed with which she managed to get the book accepted, edited and printed is quite astounding. By early December 1934, she was working with an editor, and less than six months after Willi’s death, the book was published by Oldenbourg, a respected German publishing house. Following precipitously on the heels of the book’s publication came an edict from the SS that banned the book’s sale, ordering all bookstores to remove it from their shelves immediately. Kate was so infuriated by this new outrage that she set out for Berlin immediately. There she proceeded to SS headquarters on the Prinz Albrechtstrasse, a dreaded place even at that time. When I once asked her whether she was not terrified as the doors closed behind her that she might never emerge again, she said with an absent look, deep in her private world, “They had already taken from me what was dearest to me. So what could they threaten me with?” But in her confrontation with the SS she must have been far from absent. She demanded to know on what grounds the book could be banned. Did it contain one critical word directed against the government, let alone a subversive one? Did they not think German readers would be indignant at the banning of a book containing essays by Oswald Spengler and Peter Dörfler, well-known, well-respected writers with no political blemish? There could be no question of discreetly silencing the reaction to such a move: she would insist on her right to publish the letters, poems and essays of her apolitical, young, gifted and mistakenly killed husband. I do not know, but I can very well imagine her adding that as a young widow with three children she was counting on the income from the book to help support her. Kate’s realism and practicality were always in evidence; she was no sentimental dreamer.</p>
            
                                <p>The SS released the book. Willi and Kate’s large circle of friends and acquaintances bought it and read it, and admiring, grateful and loving letters of tribute began to pour in to Kate. Willi’s immediate family, Walter and Toni Schmid and Franz and Elli Ringler, were somewhat put off by Kate’s willingness to express private matters: they felt she should not have included his poems and personal letters to her in the book. She had done it to present a rounded picture of him. This private, self-controlled, even straitlaced-appearing man should be seen in the round. He was pious and convinced of the tenets of his religion, but he was also enlightened and liberal, a good European in a nationalistic epoch. He strove hard to learn and grow, and worked seriously and indefatigably. Yet, there was his delight in life, in beauty, music, landscape, home and family. His gratitude to his creator was ingrained in his nature, his submission to God’s will was an integral part of him, not an appurtenance. This unfashionable holdover from the long-ago days of a Christian Europe helped him to withstand the troubles and trials that did not cease to beset him. His serenity was, in the last analysis, born of his faith.</p>
            
                                <p>Willi had not been a simple character, this Bavarian Catholic who had married a Jew, and in the book Kate wanted to recount all his complexities. The collection of a man’s writings edited by his loving wife does not, of course, throw much light on weaknesses, confusions, and faults. Kate included only what would redound to Willi’s credit, and in her choices must necessarily have been guided in considerable part by the political realities in Nazi Germany. We may surmise that his revulsion at the barbarities that the Nazis perpetrated in their rise to power must have found expression from time to time. His disgust with the politics of his time was great, and yet the only evidence of his political outlook occurs in a letter to his friend Wolfgang Graeser. He writes to Graeser,</p>
            
                                <p class="inset first last">I consider [Mussolini’s drive for power] pretty naïve, since after all, what is the world at present, what is Europe, and within Europe, what is Italy?…He has Italian youth with him and is stepping up their enthusiasm by convincing them with gestures of imperialism.…His last speech with his talk about ‘eternal borders’ is just a tirade.…Can you see that I would rather be a Utopian à la Ghandi? There I see real greatness…Mussolini does not have a single heroic, earth-embracing thought.</p>
            
                                <p>I take pride in that preference for Ghandi: it is a long road from a Bavarian Catholic upbringing to holding non-violence in high esteem. It perfectly serves to illustrate how profoundly opposed Willi’s ideas were to those of the Nazis. Ghandi’s central idea was that there is a basic human obligation to respect all life. It is impossible to contrast this with Nazi ideas of the superiority of certain races without weeping. Ghandi was murdered. Willi was murdered. In her condolence letter to Kate after June 30, Nina Courant wrote: “Could they not see that they had the wrong man…” The very fact of Willi’s moderation, his gentle manner, may have egged his executioners on.</p>

                                <p>The Nazis put severe pressure on Kate after the murder. As brave as she was, the fate of being the widow of someone who had become by the manner of his death, if for no other reason, an irritation to the Nazis, must have been frightening and wearing in the extreme. Added to this was her Jewishness. I am quite certain that Kate had a letter from Alvensleben in which he acknowledged his paternity. But she was nominally a Tietz, and both Hedwig and Adolf Tietz had been involved in Schwerin’s Jewish community. Alvensleben’s letter was Kate’s deepest secret: I certainly never saw it, and she probably burned it after we came to America. Yet I am convinced that she had it; she said so once, quickly and as though in passing. And how else could she have been quite so fearless?</p>

                                <p>We children had been kept ignorant of our partially Jewish heritage. Willi and Kate may have made that decision together. I do not even recall having heard the word Jew, except once. Vati and I, hand in hand, were walking along Reitmorstrasse on an errand. A boy I did not know, about my age, started yelling, <em>“Judenmaedel! Judenmaedel!”</em> (“Jew girl! Jew girl!”) at me. I was quite surprised although not at all perturbed. Since he was yelling in a “nyah, nyah” tone, I could figure out that he wasn’t being complimentary, but I had absolutely no idea what the word might mean. I turned to Vati to ask, <em>“Was heisst das?”</em> (What is that?), but for once I got no answer other than, <em>“Nichts”</em> (Nothing). Still holding my hand, Vati crossed to the other side of the street with me, saying nothing to the boy. I never saw that boy again nor heard the word again until I was in the fourth grade, and one of the boys in my class talked about emigrating to Palestine, but the incident stayed engraved in my mind: what could have such a strange, powerful effect on Vati? When a few years later the name of one of Munich’s biggest department stores was changed from Tietz to Hertie (for Hermann Tietz, the former Jewish owner), I remember noting the fact that Tietz was also our grandmother’s last name, but I did not draw the conclusion that therefore she might also be Jewish. Why not? I now wonder.</p>

                                <p>The abrogation of Jewish civil rights in Germany began on April 1, 1933, two months after Hitler became chancellor. It was the day the books were burned. Among them were works of: Kokoschka, Karl Kraus, Silone, Rudolf Steiner, Bertha von Suttner, Felix Salten, Gide, Giraudoux, Freud, Joseph Roth, Rathenau, Einstein, Henri Barbusse, Sinclair Lewis, Sholem Asch, Else Lasker-Schüler, Malraux, and Heinrich and Thomas Mann. This is just a fraction of the writers affected. Willi’s thoughts on the subject are unimaginable.</p>

                                <p>The winter of 1932 had been a winter of despair in Germany. Next to the front door there was a little table with a drawer for Kate’s gloves. It held a bowl of change. All day long people, mostly men, rang the doorbell to ask whether we had any work for them. The grown-ups were worn out with answering the door, and having to say that we had no work, but wouldn’t the men accept some change from the bowl to tide them over? I was occasionally allowed to answer the door and speak to the person outside. I remember the tension in the air: a grown man, in my memory always hollow-cheeked, lifting off his hat and asking a seven-year-old for work. Americans who recall the Depression will know all about it. The men and I found it hard to look at each other. <em>“Grüss Gott,”</em> I would say and as quickly as possible, and trying not to be out-and-out rude, I would grab a handful of change and press it into the man’s hand before he could refuse. The way the gift was usually acknowledged was the old Bavarian <em>“Vergelt’s Gott”</em> (May God reward you), to which the reply was not the conventional German <em>“Bitte”</em> (you’re welcome), but <em>“Segn’s Gott”</em> (May God bless). I remember exactly the tension, the pity that filled me because it seemed so completely the wrong way around that this grownup should have to thank me. I was always immensely relieved when I could close the door and not have to embarrass the man any longer. It was quite clear to a small child that the times were out of joint: the violence visited upon men’s dignity was an offense to the natural order. Vati explained to me that times were very hard, and that it was up to us to help as much as possible, and he would tell the story of St. Martin who gave half his cloak to a poor shivering peasant. The German is, literally, <em>der heilige Martin,</em> (the holy Martin) — cozier by far, it seems to me, than “St. Martin,” which sounds more like a title. The holy Martin is the saint of the poor.</p>

                                <p>At the end of April 1933, Thomi and I went to stay in Aarau, living in the beautiful, beloved Blumenhalde, a rather grand house complete with park-like grounds, a pond, greenhouse, and mini-farm where our friends, the Oehlers, lived. Uncle Alfred Oehler (a courtesy uncle) and Tante Marguerite had offered to take Thomi and me for some months and Willi and Kate had accepted their kindness. Our parents were in severe straits. All of Willi’s attempts to find work had come to naught, and all three part-time jobs he had had were terminated in the late twenties. The newspaper he worked for, <em>The Bayrische Kurier,</em> went bankrupt. His editor wrote, “It cuts me to the quick to have to notify friends of this, with whom I worked so closely and so well. May God give us better times. I don’t know how I can bear the collapse of my twenty-five years of work.”</p>

                                <p>Another job Willi had held was with Kösel and Pustet, a prominent Catholic publishing house, where he was editing a series called Musica Sacra, which barely got off the ground due to the catastrophic economic conditions. <em>Geheimrat</em> (Privy Councilor) Friedrich Pustet wrote to Willi a most kindly, personal letter canceling his contract, because Kösel and Pustet were dissolving the Oratoriumsverlag, the division for music. The letter is dated 29 December, 1926. Pustet, addressing the letter to <em>“Hochwohlgeboren,”</em> (something like, The Right Honorable) Dr. Wilhelm Schmid, writes in part: </p>

                                <p class="inset first last">It is certainly not your fault that we were unable to use your abilities as we would have wished. You may consider the fact that some time ago you were offered expanded opportunities in the editorial activities of the company, a measure of our great esteem for you. That nothing came of these plans is due to the fact that the economic distress of the time forced us to reduce our activities to a minimum. I find this particularly painful because I had looked forward to closer collaboration with you and instead I have to suggest a dissolution of our relationship with you. It is all the more painful because you demonstrated editorial and propagandistic [‘publicity,’ I believe is meant] talents that showed that along with your idealism, you have a well-developed grasp of the economic aspects of publishing that would have made you eminently suitable for such a task. I do not doubt for a minute that your extensive abilities will make it easy for you [!!] to find a probably even more advantageous position elsewhere, as even in times like the present, demand for abilities as far above the average as yours exceeds the supply.</p>

                                <p>Pustet continues in this vein, quite certain that Willi will find a better job with another publisher and full of praise for his “many-sided aptitude,” “outstanding professional qualification,” “enthusiasm for the work,” and “such congenial manners.” In fact, of course, finding another job in publishing at that time was about as likely as finding gold in Munich’s streets. Pustet concludes “with a heavy heart” that he will do all he can to help Willi find work, and sends “best New Year’s wishes.” Presumably the Schmids had had a peaceful Christmas, at least, but this blow must not have made for much of a New Year’s celebration.</p>

                                <p>On December 20, 1927, <em>Verlagsanstalt des Nürnberger Bundes</em> canceled Willi’s contract, so that Willi and Kate were aware of this new misfortune in time for Christmas. A third part-time job with another publishing venture also evaporated, “due to circumstances.” This was the year that the well-known publisher Kurt Wolff shut down his business in Germany, took his money and moved to Switzerland. Willi did not have that choice; he was at the beginning of his career and faced ruin. <em>“Ich stehe schon wieder einmal vor dem Nichts,”</em> (I am faced with an abyss once more) he wrote to Jablonski.</p>

                                <p>While we children were in Aarau, we received a stream of cards and letters from our parents, but it was very hard on us and them to be separated. Thomi suffered especially. Although he was the apple of Marguerite Oehler’s eye, and we had the run of the beautiful garden and all sorts of treats, Thomi was quite literally sick for home and parents. He refused as far as possible to go visiting while in Aarau: “What I like best is to be with Mutti. Now I’ve got used to being here, but I don’t want to visit anybody.”</p>

                                <p>I was in somewhat better shape: The Oehlers had an adopted daughter, <em>Musli</em> (“Little Mouse”), and we two girls got along quite nicely. I liked my school, and various festivities in which we participated in Aarau, parades and outings. I made friends with a sweet girl, Regeli Schreck, and we together rampaged through her mother’s gooseberry and currant bushes. At home in the Blumenhalde I regularly escaped the enforced nap after lunch. Sneaking out by way of the dining room, where I would steal a few Brazil nuts (so hard to open! The time wasted — dangerously, in terms of being found out—with a nutcracker! But greed drove me to it) and proceed to the phlox beds in the garden. If I scootched down I was invisible among the tall phlox and could bake in the sun and read to my heart’s content. The gardener Hans’ return to work from his own siesta would alert me that I had to skip back to my room to emerge, virtuously, from my supposed nap.</p>

                                <p>Hans must have seen me, but he was the children’s friend. I know that he saved my little brother from a life of misery in Aarau. Thomi loved Hans devotedly. Hans knew how to do everything, was patient and kind, and full of wonderful stories from his Swiss army service. He was also full of sayings and precepts, every one of which Thomi made his own and took to heart. Once when Tante Sophie, Marguerite Oehler’s sister, gesticulated and grazed Thomi’s nose by mistake, for which she instantly apologized, he, aged 6, intoned, “An old warrior bears injuries with equanimity.”</p>

                                <p>Unlike little Thomi, I, at least, could write letters home. I understood that we were fortunate to be in that beautiful place with the Oehlers who were so good to us. I was doing my best to be appropriately grateful (shades of the ice-cream boat!), but I was struggling. The only expression of my suppressed anxiety was that I soiled my underwear time and again by refusing to use the bathroom at school. I would then “inexplicably” lose the underwear, as I explained over and over to Tante Marguerite. She was very patient about buying an endless supply of underpants.</p>

                                <p>Once visitors from Munich looked us up in the Blumenhalde, and this was great cause for excitement and celebration. I wrote to my mother in June 1933: “Did you know that Uncle Willy [Merkl] visited us? It was so great, and I thought of a passage in my Spyri-book where Fanny says, ‘Thank goodness, I get to see someone from home’ — but don’t worry, Mutti, I’m <em>not</em> homesick.”</p>

                                <p>Kate retold the story of that letter to my patron at the Nonnberg (known to the whole world, more or less, as the convent where Maria von Trapp, of <em>The Sound of Music,</em> was a novice), so that is how the tale was preserved. Thomi and I both had patronesses on the Nonnberg. Frau Erentrudis, or Lady Erentrudis, a serious person of great dignity, was mine; Thomi’s was Lady Theresia — much sweeter — I was jealous. These Benedictines were scholars, and spent their summers at the Chiemsee in Bavaria, where we as a family also stayed in the summers of 1931 and 1932, with grandparents and Garmisch cousins. The ancient Benedictine associations between the Nonnberg, a Benedictine convent founded in 700, and Frauenchiemsee were not known to us children, but we did gather that convents were in some way outside national boundaries, had some sort of independence from political sovereignty. We thought of Frau Erentrudis and Frau Theresia as something like our guardian angels’ helpers: the dear Lord would be helped to keep us especially in mind by our nuns and our angels.</p>
                                 
                                <p>During our stay in Aarau, Kate and Willi, left only with baby Hedi, took in paying guests. One of these, Eva Reifenberg, became another lifelong friend. She was sent to my mother to learn cooking, I believe, by her aunt, Frau Kaula, who lived in Munich. Eva came from a wealthy Cologne banking family, who were very musical, Jewish, and who supported young musicians, sponsoring concerts. Eva was a bit overawed by her masterful mother, and did not find it altogether easy to adjust to life with my mother, either. Kate was overwhelming in her own way. But Kate’s warm heart prevailed: Eva became a sort of member of our family. She married the cellist Emmanuel Feuermann, and their daughter Monica was close in age to Bettina Hoerlin, our youngest sister, so the friendship descended to the next generation. Eva was a beloved friend of our family until she died.</p>

                                <p>When I came back from Switzerland in September 1933, I was enrolled in the private <em>Ebermeyer Schule.</em> I was in fourth grade. It is an indication of our parents’ protectiveness, because the school seems in retrospect to have been, if not an anti-Nazi, then certainly a liberal haven. The two sisters who ran it, Fraulein Ernestine and Fraulein Ottilie, were calm, tolerant gentlewomen. It was my first experience of a coeducational school, one attended primarily by the children of intellectuals. Maybe it was a progressive school. When I visited my new classmates’ houses, I saw pianos and book-lined rooms reminiscent of home, and no one seemed to be going off to Hitler youth meetings. My belief right through our departure for Salzburg in February 1937 was that Kate did not want her children in any Nazi organization, which was no doubt true. What I did not know is that such organizations would not have permitted us to join even if we had wanted to, because we were partly Jewish.</p>

                                <p>By the time my parents (finally! in my childish view) brought us home in 1933, Willi had been hired by the <em>MNN</em> as an editor and chief music critic. He was given the job on a provisional basis. He was certainly well qualified for it, and it was a lifesaver at the time. The Nazis’ tyranny over Germany had expanded at a terrifying pace. They had been consummately thorough in seizing power over every facet of public life. People were beginning to be faced with moral dilemmas they had never anticipated, with having to make unpleasant compromises. It is astonishing to look at the extent to which compromise was necessary to escape official censure or displeasure so soon after Hitler’s accession to power. Almost no one in Germany had anticipated the speed and ruthlessness with which Hitler silenced opposition. The rapidity and cruelty with which opposition leaders disappeared into camps, the street fights orchestrated by the SA, the beatings and shootings, the destruction of, for example, Social Democratic printing presses, all these measures of oppression occured everywhere within a few months of the Nazi takeover. But what made all these outrages so effective, that is, so helpful to the Nazis and so destructive of German democracy, was the almost total failure on the part of Germany’s intellectual, legal, business and military establishment to stand up for traditional standards of civic society. One cannot expect most people to be heroes: the very word hero implies standing out from the crowd. But one might have thought that a culture that particularly valued the kind of courage called Schneid in German, perhaps best translated as “nerve,” would face facts, instead of closing its eyes—would speak out as laws were scornfully, shamelessly defied by the government. The extreme deference to the state, to governing officials, that was fostered in Wilhelmine Germany accounts for part of the servility and moral cowardice evinced by the Germans of the 1930s. No one grew up in Germany believing that speaking up in Town Meeting was his God-given right. The economic misery following World War I, the bafflement and depression of millions of war veterans who had fought bravely only to become losers, not heroes, the fearsome chaos in nearby Russia, and other factors combined to intimidate the German population. Yet the fear and trembling with which most academics put their own interest above that of the country at large, the willingness of the parliament and the legal profession to relinquish the law, and turn to dangerous expedients that curtailed individual freedom and fundamentally altered democratic government, the inclination of ordinary Germans to see no evil even when evil plain as day was perpetrated in front of their eyes, the intoxication with the irrational rantings, trappings and masquerades of the Nazis: all this was, in my mind, an inexplicable disintegration of a great people. No matter what explanations have been adduced by a great number of historians, the failure of nerve in response to the rise of Hitler is hard to comprehend. Heine long ago wrote</p>

                                <p class="inset first"><em>Denk’ ich an Deutschland in der Nacht</em></p>
                                <p class="inset last"><em>So bin ich um den Schlaf gebracht.	</em></p>	

                                <p class="inset">When I think of Germany in the night</p>
                                <p class="inset last">I am deprived of sleep.</p> 	

                                <p>Kate often quoted those lines; she felt that way, and I still do sometimes. I suppose that after the generation that experienced the Nazi regime and its consequences, and lived through World War II, dies out, there may be a change of attitude toward the German enigma.</p>

                                <div class="rest"></div>

                                <p>Willi began his stint at the <em>MNN</em> in July 1933, in time for Munich’s annual opera festival. The former editor of the paper had already been replaced by the Nazi Hausleiter, as we have seen. Shortly afterwards Willi, and every other white-collar employee, received a notification stating that, “in accordance with orders from the Political Police,” all current employment contracts were herewith cancelled and would be reviewed. In the meantime Willi would work as the reviewer/critic responsible for music and <em>Musikpolitik</em> (the political aspect of music). Needless to say that is a Nazi formulation. There is no such word in the dictionary. One may look at Willi’s probable signature on the official request to acknowledge this notification as a first compromise. One could imagine that in a free country such a request would meet with incredulous indignation—what’s <em>Musikpolitik</em> supposed to mean? Who do you think I am to do your ideological dirty work for you? We do not have the piece of paper that Willi probably signed, nor do we have an indication, let alone proof, that he thought to himself, “Right, hell can freeze over before I introduce ideology into my reviews of music-making.” We have the reviews he did, such as the one about the <em>Magic Flute,</em> that entirely preserve his disinterestedness, caring only about the music. I should have translated more pieces from the <em>Unvollendete</em>, and perhaps I will at another time, so you can get more of a grasp of Willi’s writing. What we do have is proof that intimidation and the resultant fear was already widespread by the middle of 1933. Those who could were beginning to leave the country, such as Albert Einstein, Hans Bethe, Richard Courant, Erwin Schrödinger, Erwin Panofsky, Max Delbrück and other academics. Some had been dismissed from their jobs on April 1, others left in protest. The musicologist Alfred Einstein who taught at Smith when I was a student there, came to the U.S. after he was dismissed from his job as music critic of a Berlin newspaper.</p> 

                                <p>Willi had very little choice. He and Kate now had us three children, and their fortunes had, as we saw, been at such a low ebb in the previous winter and spring that Thomi and I were farmed out to the Oehlers, while the Schmids took in paying guests. Our parents’ profound love for us and their sense of mission about raising us as God-fearing, responsible and happy children was a matter of great concern to them. I have mentioned previously that Vati spent a lot of time teaching us how a good person behaves. He paid close attention to my preparation for my first communion, and wrote out the Lord’s Prayer and the Ave Maria for Thomi to take with him to Switzerland. Our encounters with Saint Nicholas on December 5th were always stately; we were in awe of his being a bishop and behaved accordingly. There was also joy mixed with majesty as we learned about the natural world. How could you not react with solemnity to the beautiful mountains? It was taken for granted that we should love each other. I felt a tremendous responsibility for Thomi as my stranglehold around his neck in the picture taken in Salzburg proves (see page 16). He really was the sweetest little boy one can imagine. Just about perfect in my eyes. Hedi was too little to learn much from Vati, but she so much delighted both parents, and Vati was especially pleased with her love of the low notes on the piano, which made her laugh with delight.</p>

                                <div id="loadEight"></div> 

                                <p>In October 1933, Pipsi died, a sad blow to Willi and the whole family. The Münchner Viol Quintet was touring as much as possible, and getting excellent reviews and high praise, but the tours had to cover living expenses and provide earnings for five people, so no one was making a fortune. </p>

                                <p>It is a pity that we have only indirect evidence of Willi’s thoughts about the Nazis. I am certain, if there were passages that took a stand in letters to friends, that Kate burned them—unless the friends had done so before they sent her the correspondence. (Both Walter Jablonski and Wolfgang Graeser saved Willi’s letters to them.) During the Weimar Republic, when Germany was still free, Willi had expressed his opinions freely. Thus in December 1918, he writes to Kate of the importance of achieving character, he wants to be one of the intellectuals and artists, he wants to reach, “the heights, a true, innermost feeling for life,” to “behave in a refined manner,” not be part of “society.” His admiration is focused on those who strive for the highest standards of behavior and comprehension. When staying with the Jablonskis in February 1919, he is put up in father Jablonski’s library, and is impressed and amazed by this businessman’s admirable collection of books, “almost a scholar’s.” He had previously informed Kate of his preference for the Social Democrats. He consistently chose tolerance and gentility over intolerance and condescension, not to speak of arrogance. He was by instinct and conviction at ease with ordinary people. He taught us that each person is sacred and that therefore the dignity of each person is to be upheld and honored. Yet, Willi had real reservations about the nobility of the common man. His distaste for mobs was profound, and he had no hesitation about his right to distance himself from the man in the street. He was not ashamed of being part of an elite and prided himself, to a considerable extent, on his esoteric preferences and taste. In everything from furnishings to human relations or the performance of chamber music, Willi aimed for the highest aesthetics and moral standards. He could sometimes be a bit precious and find his fellowmen wanting in many respects. The thought of Kate dancing with strangers, “just because they can turn in circles with a passable sense of rhythm,” sends him into paroxysms of jealous disdain. As to the apache dance that Kate performed with her cousin in Berlin—perish the thought of something so vulgar. Poor Schwerin: its cultural offerings do not come up to Willi’s demanding standards. Mixing various kinds of music, at an “orchestra evening,” playing isolated movements of pieces: “very primitive.” On December 5 he writes: “the intense ideality of my life only allows me to dare confrontation with reality accompanied by anxiety and dread of injury.” Here Willi seems to be borrowing sensitivity from Kafka or Rilke, approaching the excessively fastidious. He needed to be aesthetically discriminating, of course, especially as a performer of music that is as transparent as the pieces he loved best. He writes to Kate about a performance he heard: “I am glad to know inwardly—I can only tell you that more than [his most musical friend] I try my utmost to reach the essence of a thing,” and he finds in that “a little source of pride.” Most of all, his letters to Kate were love letters, as long as he lived. In the next section we will sample a few.</p>

                            <p>If it were not for the many letters that passed between Willi and Kate, the feasibility of writing these reminiscences would have been out of the question. I am very, very grateful to Kate for her habit of saving his letters.</p>

                            <p>They met on August 20, 1918. At the beginning of November, Kate began to save his letters. We benefit from the fact that they were separated for almost three years before their wedding, and that afterwards he wrote her many letters from his frequent trips. What stands out in the text is his devotion to music, his hard work, and his deep love for her.</p>

                            <p>On December 1, 1918, he remembers the Thursday on which Kate left to go home to Schwerin: “That last hour...I have managed to visit it and to let it console me with all its pain and all its bliss — do you do that from time to time? When I recall your last kiss and how we clung to each other, longing nearly bursts my heart, consumed with love for you, dearest, my only human being, friend and companion.”</p>

                            <p>On December 4, he is strong enough to attend Bruckner’s Third Symphony conducted by Pfitzner, even though the trams stopped running by 7 p.m. because of a shortness of coal. “It makes for a long way home,” says Willi, quite unfazed. He also tells Kate that he will join the Bach Society, “a small chorus only, but very good. The next concert will feature a funeral ode and the great five-voiced Magnificat, a splendid piece. The first rehearsal is Saturday. It will be a pleasure, and I’m looking forward to it a lot.” There is no anxiety about trying out for the chorus! The next day he reports that the Bruckner was beautiful: “that would have been something for you.  Just wait, you are going to be dragged to a lot, you poor thing….Are you already aware that I am not a Wagnerian? Just so you won’t be disappointed. On the other hand I am getting to be more and more of a Mozart devotee.  I am spending a lot of time studying Köchel, the great Mozart catalogue, and reading the conscientious, great John biography. Learn to play Mozart well, that is the criterion for all those musicians who have a finely developed sense of harmony and formal content.  It takes a lot of perception, much more than Beethoven, and that is why I love it so much (because I feel my own shortcoming).” He returns to the subject of Wagner a week later. “I just don’t like him, I find him repugnant as a man as well as an artist. He is one of those with an impure, innermost hypocritical character: Nietzsche knew him best. Just think of his position against the Jews, his wretched, perverse, oppressive, lewd music, his lamentable position toward philosophy with the whimpering conversion to Christianity in Parsifal, and so on. I could say a lot about this. <em>The Meistersinger</em> is relatively the least Wagner-like, and therefore surely the best. Tristan is beautiful but, for me, unhealthy – it has the fascination of a sultry, decaying exotic flower. I went through a period of great enthusiasm for him only to be now clear in my aversion. He is as un-German as he can be, that ‘German master.’ A genius, but God preserve us from many such!”</p>

                            <p>On December 9 he tells Kate that, “nothing can part two people who have experienced this degree of closeness. How rich we have become through this fair miracle.” His heart is often full to overflowing, but his comprehension remains clear. He knows his understanding of Italian art is superior, but he hopes to gain access to German art in time: Gruenewald’s Isenheim Altar is being exhibited in Munich prior to its return to Colmar (it had been moved to Munich for safekeeping during the war). “People are as devout as though they were in church, a mass migration to the Pinakothek is in progress...Actually it is sad that I can’t experience this, and I am pained by the limitations of myself.”</p>

                            <p>On December 19, 1918, he tells of attending a concert he truly loved, three string quartets by Beethoven: “It includes the quartet in C-sharp minor [Op. 131], that pinnacle of art which is of unearthly greatness and magnificence, a manifestation of this genius which transcends wisdom and philosophy.” This will always be “the most sacred music for me... [Op. 132] played one of the most important roles in my development” and it will be a “blessed day” when Kate gets to hear it.  The late quartets accompany Willi to the Hoinerhof in August 1919, and in January 1921 he writes, “I’m having them bound in leather since that’s something one needs one’s whole life long.”</p>

                            <p>But Mozart is the touchstone.  On February 12, 1921, a Sunday, he writes to Kate,</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">[T]his morning I gave myself a great treat. I went to quite a decent performance of sacred choral works by Mozart. Oh my darling, how beautiful, how beautiful. I was in heaven, my home and my country. Do you think there are many people who can love Mozart the way I do? I am like a child with him: my heart beats faster, every move of the musical line, every change in the harmony makes me resonate, I can feel what took place in his soul at that moment. Sometimes it seems to me that I would have had to speak, to sing like that—and yet it is on such a god-like level, so unattainably perfect. I intend to reach that goal in my life: that I get to know everything Mozart wrote, everything, every note. I want to work my way through the big Abert with the aid of scores, no part of his immense work must remain unknown to me. I must obtain and own the Breitkopf and Härtel Complete Works. They probably cost thousands at this point, but I will save, will work for them, any menial work will suit me.  Maybe I seem eccentric or crazy to you as I say that, but when I think of the life that lies before me I really want to savor deeply all that I can grasp.  And that is a lot...my longing is full of energy. I urgently desire the whole range of the world, art and knowledge...I don’t ask myself whether all this collecting and storing will bear fruit some day...I don’t dare to hope: ‘now only sticks, these trees will one day bear fruit and give shade,’ but it is not resignation, not despair, not brooding, it is waiting, without anxiety or fear.</p>

                            <p>At one point he refers to Kate’s having heard <em>Bastien and Bastienne,</em> and writes, “[it] is so charming...When one thinks that its dear little melodies were composed by a twelve-year-old boy in Vienna, one would instantly like to be a hundred and fifty years younger so one could be there.” During the Christmas holidays of 1920–1921, Willi visited Kate in Schwerin, and they attended a performance of <em>The Magic Flute</em> together. On his way back to Munich Willi writes, “My head is still full of melodies from <em>The Magic Flute.</em> I am so happy that you appreciate the perfect sweetness and serenity, the southern grace and perfection of form, the depth and maturity of this seriousness—that you love Mozart as I do.”</p>

                            <p>The Magic Flute was my first opera. Vati took me to hear it in the winter before his death, when I was just nine. He prepared me for the event by telling me the story and singing and playing some of the most crucial melodies. I had a light blue velvet dress made especially for the occasion, my first long dress. Papageno enchanted me, <em>“Dies Bildnis”</em> brought tears to my eyes, Zarastro awed me, the Queen of the Night frightened me thoroughly. The whole thing seemed more than perfect, something I could not get over, a live fairy tale filled with inconceivably beautiful sound: just right there, on a cold, rainy, wintry night in Munich, to be had for the price of admission!</p>

                            <p>That night, Zarastro was sung by Paul Bender, a big, imposing man with a glorious <em>basso profundo,</em> a Mozart specialist. Vati wrote in the review: “Since we came to find joy, he takes us into his keeping as he does Pamina and Tamino, and leads us to a better land. Can there be a greater satisfaction for an artist than to be no longer just a bass who sings his role, but a wise man who, through Mozart, teaches by giving, gives by teaching?” My experience was heightened by the realization that Willi was somehow an initiate of that charmed, spellbinding world which lifted ordinary people to elysian heights, making their eyes shine, their speech joyous, their faces gentle. The unforgettable evening was stored in my heart with a sense of anticipation: now that I was old enough, there would be other such evenings. Vati said that he would take me again, and introduce me to <em>Figaro, the Seraglio, Rigoletto</em> — so much glory out there for me to get to know. But that shining future never came.</p>

                            <p>In 1921, in fact thirteen years to the day before Willi was killed, he writes to Kate, “I can hardly think of the slow movement of [Mozart’s] G minor quintet [K. 516]. One can be submerged in it as in everlasting salvation, from which one wants never again to emerge. This kind of bliss is unique to Mozart. It’s a Catholic bliss. There is no individual in it, no body, nothing material, no more Judaism, only the radiance of God.” I assume that Judaism refers to the teaching of the Old Testament, the stern Jehovah. The Catholic in Mozart was a theme that occupied Willi more as he himself became more deeply committed to Catholicism. His Catholicism was deeply private and concerned the sources of Catholic faith, not the reign of priests over the populace or the ambitions of churchmen. I cannot judge whether the affinity between Mozart’s religion and his music is really there or whether Willi’s personal view led him to imagine it. I translated the essay on The Catholic in Mozart and you can read it in the appendix.</p>

                            <p>All of Willi’s striving in the three years between their meeting and their marriage was directed toward winning Kate for his wife. His passionate love for her, and the seriousness with which he regards their relationship from the first, are apparent in his earliest letters. The brevity of their acquaintance seems to have no bearing on the depth of his commitment. “You know that I can barely keep a rein on my heart where you are concerned, that I can barely restrain the painful abundance of my love….the essential point, the focus around which everything revolves is always you... What is there to fear with the feeling of love in our hearts?  We are sure of ourselves, no matter what collapses.”</p>

                            <p>This was an apt quotation, because the old world was indeed collapsing. The house of Wittelsbach had been overthrown after 739 years, and the new republican government featured remarkably apolitical politicians. The first president of the democratic, socialist Bavarian republic was Kurt Eisner, a lawyer, a Prussian and a Jew. The minister of culture was Gustav Landauer, a Shakespearean scholar and medievalist, and the new commander-in-chief of the Bavarian army was Ernst Toller, a poet and playwright. Both were Jews.  On November 8 Willi writes to Kate,</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">We had an unbloody but thorough revolution here yesterday. A council of workers, one of soldiers, and one of peasants [<em>Bauern</em>] was formed and a republic proclaimed. Otherwise all is quite orderly, so there’s nothing to be concerned about. All went off in good order...so far they have managed to keep order and I expect there won’t be a counterrevolution...I am completely in agreement with this new order as far as it goes in concept, though of course I disapprove and oppose much of the form and practice. I’ve never been one of the real independents but have always been a convinced democrat. Only my reservations about the masses, about the instincts of crowds, have always been so great that I could never bring myself to play a part. I’ll have to see whether I can overcome my aversion because I think it’s absolutely necessary that every individual, no matter what, whether in agreement or not, contribute his bit, so we won’t have conditions like they do in Russia.</p>

                            <p>Willi was too cosmopolitan in his outlook to be limited to traditional Bavarian attitudes.  His ethics were modeled not only on his family and teachers, but on his wide reading, his study of Aristotle, St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Montesquieu and so on. His virtues did not accompany him from birth. He worked at incorporating into his life the qualities he admired, and he taught us children to value and emulate what makes a good human being, a <em>Mensch.</em> Religious faith was part of this, and gave daily life an un-Puritan ease. Of course people offended against the Golden Rule and sinned against the commandments, but the commandments and the obligation to do unto others as you would have them do unto you were still thoroughly taught. By the time I was seven or eight I knew that we were all children of God, and thus I was tranquil, but I also knew that we were all “poor sinners.”  There was neither much confusion about what was expected, nor extensive latitude about what was tolerated. In that way it was a very different world from our present one, and in the still largely agrarian Bavaria one could perceive one of the last strongholds of an ancient piety.</p>

                            <p>While Willi was teaching in the public schools, he was also attending Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich. He had begun in 1913–14, with special attention to Romance languages, and a course by Karl Vossler (1872–1949) who later became one of his friends. Vossler was a professor of Romance languages and later <em>Rektor</em> (that is, President) of Ludwig-Maximilian University. He was one of Willi’s favorite professors, as was Professor Bäumker, about whom he remarked that he was <em>“humanissimus vir,”</em> a most human, refined teacher, “a good old-fashioned philosopher, with all the resources of his comprehensive erudition...And thirty or forty people with good heads…all of them courteous, [disputing] with well-bred interaction: all of that makes for a most agreeable ease.”<span class="citation">45</span> Another of his teachers was Viktor Klemperer, the author of <em>I Will Bear Witness,</em> a diary of the Nazi oppression of its Jewish citizens. He taught exercises in Montesquieu’s <em>Lettres Persanes,</em> and also a course on Petrarca. Willi would graduate in 1923 with a Ph.D. thesis on Don Bosco, an Italian pedagogue.</p>

                            <p>He was also taking private cello instruction with Hegar, a well-known teacher, and gamba lessons with Döbereiner. His faithful attendance at concerts continued: The Berlin Cathedral Choir, the Berber Quartet, a Kempff recital, the Konzertverein with Bruno Walter, a Reger quintet, an evening of Bach in the Lukas Church, Trude Hirsch’s quartet. “I was in a concert with [his brother] Walter, all ancient music, Döbereiner played the gamba beautifully,” and the <em>Missa Solemnis,</em> Bach’s <em>St. John Passion,</em> Lampe playing a Mozart concert, “Saturday’s concert: Seiler played very beautifully, especially in the A minor piano quartet,” and on and on. He also says, longingly, “By the beginning of the next concert season, I hope to have finished everything (exams, Ph.D., job at a Munich secondary school); then I will continue and finish with Hegar. One must at all events take precautions for the future and be prepared. If Germany’s economic situation improves in a few years it’s a given that I can get into a good quartet.”</p> 

                            <p>After one of her visits, Willi writes to Kate, “It has gotten very late by Bavarian standards, 10:30 pm, and I’m going to sleep... Now, in the days gone by (oh, they are so completely alive still!) I was often afraid that you could believe even for a moment that my caresses and my desire for your kisses and your embrace were the whole of my love. But you must sense and feel that in you, your complete being, not only your physical being, is contained the ultimate, divine quality that we call love... the blissful longing. Are we not uniquely fortunate to be able to experience that? In the fullness, the radiance of our happiness to keep craving for a new, higher, more ennobled merging of our lives? On how few people, love, is such happiness bestowed—and yet this is just the beginning of the shining light in store for us.”<span class="citation">46</span></p>

                            <p>On November 20, after receiving a letter from one of Kate’s friends, he is moved to say, “In fact it is a blessing that I am not as intellectually cut out as the young ladies of today. Thus, for example, I have never had to battle with ‘the separation between man and woman’. On the contrary, up to now I have always pursued what unites them, and been well pleased. There again you can see how foolish I am.”</p>

                            <p>When Kate sent him some Delacroix reproductions, he writes: “I’ve quickly leafed through it. I do think that with Delacroix of all people almost everything is in the color, and so the photographs make one long for it. Nonetheless, I am very pleased, and thank you for it, although as a frugal future (if it pleases God and you) husband, I have to wrinkle my brow at the unnecessary expense. I have a hellish fire glowing in my stove, the only possible state of affairs in this coldest of worlds. How I hate the winter...”<span class="citation">47</span></p>

                            <p>On January 20, 1921, he misses his train back to Allach, and writes, “So I walked to Nymphenburg to the Botanical Garden, and spent two blissful hours, since by now it made no difference, dreaming in warmth, fragrance and solitude as the only visitor. The orchids are in bloom and one is enchanted by all the charm and multitudinous allures – sweet grace, and heavy, dark splendor...I was very, very happy. And then I could think that your thoughts were turned to me, my dearest. I can’t write sensibly today...”</p>

                            <p>On February 4, 1921, Willi expresses regret that his English is only elementary: “I know almost no English and largely feel my way…the Shakespeare sonnets, surely among the most beautiful of all the world’s love poems, and which appeal to me to such an extent that I can even feel enthusiasm and love for the beauty of a young man. One has to go back to the Greeks to find anything so perfectly formed and shaped…Wait until we can experience all that together!”</p>

                            <p>Since Willi and Kate are thinking of marriage in the near future, they are also embarked on a search for wedding rings. On this subject, Willi writes ruefully: “When I think that coming home from Italy in 1914, I was so fabulously stupid as to exchange six French twenty-franc gold pieces, at a great loss, for Reichsmark!!! But it’s better not to think of it.”<span class="citation">48</span> “There is something particular about those symbols. The idea becomes very clear: these two rings will accompany us to our death, which as yet we cannot picture, and yet it will come some day, separating spouse from spouse...The thought of being part of that great chain has nothing desolate for me, I look at its incomprehensible meaning with dignity and reverence.”<span class="citation">49</span></p>

                            <p>At this point Willi was teaching in elementary school in Allach. This is the time when Willi had the experience with Monika, one of his pupils. He writes to Kate on February 1, “The first Allach snowdrops. A child brought them to me.”  The story of Monika is told in the appendix.</p>

                            <p>The next few years demanded a concentrated effort on Willi’s part to demonstrate his value as a contributor, and to produce respected publications. It is also the period of his close association with Wolfgang Graeser concerning the first performance ever of Bach’s <em>The Art of Fugue.</em> Graeser had written an analysis of <em>The Art of Fugue</em> in 1924 in the Bach Gesellschaft publication, and by 1926 was looking for an appropriate place for a premiere. Graeser and Willi considered Munich but settled on Leipzig as the proper place. In those years Willi writes to Jablonski, “I am engaged with Bach, as always.”<span class="citation">50</span> The performance of <em>The Art of Fugue</em> was to take place in March, and Willi is writing an introduction to it.  He wrote,</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">Everything is managed with deliberation, organization, architecture, and conveys utter calm and stability, it is as firm as a rock. Every consummate artistic achievement combines utmost vigor, a principled command of technique and beauty, and strict observance of artistic requirements. That is the greatest triumph of art, its glory and its gift of proffering happiness, that every listener, every one who contemplates it with even the most elementary sense for music, will come away with a deep, enduring impression. This synchronization of being open and being concealed, the clarity and the farsightedness…give one a look into the unfathomable.</p>

                            <p>He adds a quote from Goethe concerning Bach: “it is as though eternal harmony spoke to itself, the way it did in God’s bosom shortly before he created the world.”</p>

                            <p>In the meantime, he worked hard on the publication of sacred music, was a correspondent for a journal called <em>Allgemeine Rundschau</em> (Universal Review) and was trying to get a job with a local Catholic paper, “pretty much of a rag,” to provide some economic security. He felt hampered by fatal inhibitions “caused by excessive self-criticism and an inferiority complex foisted on me by a wrong education.”<span class="citation">51</span></p>

                            <p>In 1928, Willi was full of plans for sharing the authorship of a book on Bach with Wolfgang Graeser. He was under no illusion: even with someone with Graeser’s capacity for work and his own conscientiousness, it would take a total of ten years. The fundamental form would be a new perception of the actual content of Bach’s life’s work and its division into tracts of time, using “a depiction rooted in the greatest beauty of description of which we are capable...” He urged Graeser to reply soon, but as their correspondence continued Graeser wrote of profound depression. Willi answered him with an affectionate, warm letter in which he refers to Graeser’s “strongly developed critical faculties...no one, believe me, criticizes you as unsparingly as you do yourself in your present state…Be of good cheer and keep going…” Wolfgang Graeser committed suicide on June 13, 1928. Willi mourned the immense loss of his friend. “I can speak with no one about it. Only Spengler understands and knows everything concerning it. Wolfskehl was very kind. He loves the two of us greatly, and hours spent with him are always happy...” Graeser’s death ended Willi’s thoughts of writing a book about Bach.</p>

                            <p>Later that year Willi wrote to Jablonski that he is devoting more time to music again: playing at the Bachfest in Nürnberg and in the German Bachfest in Kassel in the fall. Other than that life is difficult: “in addition to criticism it is lots of trouble to earn a living. But it’s coming along and may go better in the future.”</p>

                            <p>Kate had lost a baby in 1923. Marlies Schmid was born on July 30 and died on August 6. This must have been a terrible blow for Kate and Willi, who carried pictures of the baby in their wallets all their lives. After the loss of Marlies, the Schmids were happy indeed to have first me, and then Thomi. Willi says: “We are so happy that one would fear the envy of the gods except that we are grateful every hour. Our little one is at such a charming age,”<span class="citation">52</span> and “I have the daily experience of living with our little one, which is entirely new to me. The unknown life of such a little person is completely fascinating to me.”<span class="citation">53</span> “We have two sweet, healthy children. Duscha is becoming consistently more trustful…she loves us all dearly and gives us nothing but joy. Little Thomi is at an age where his soul is unfolding in an incomparable, heavenly fashion, tenderly and purely. Every smile contains a world of splendor.”<span class="citation">54</span></p>

                            <p>When it was <em>Fasching</em> in Munich, Willi wrote that it brought surges of delight to Munich, “beautiful women and ardent men.” Kate was Wolfkehl’s chosen queen, he celebrated her with flowers and poems, and Willi says: “He is really splendid, so young, so old-fashionedly young…he is quite entrancing, and very kind.” (The “young” Wolfskehl was in his sixties!) In a Puritan country it is hard to explain Fasching. It was a time when the town was off duty, a little crazy and happy.</p>   

                            <p>Beginning about this time Willi kept separate folders and entered his research in them: on Rameau, on Strauss, on Verdi, on Bach, on Casals and so forth, one on sketches for talks or articles. They were sources for his reviews and were assembled in libraries ranging from the <em>Staatsbibliothek</em> in Munich and Berlin to libraries in Paris and Rome, Florence and Milan.  He was a firm believer in seeing the original composition. He worked very hard, constantly beset by lack of time. There were other hardships as well: the libraries were often closed, they were frequently freezing, the rain would soak his shoes, his hands would be too frozen in his cheap lodging to write, except in bed. He missed his family terribly, writing to Kate, “I know full well that this [stay] is necessary, but I long for you and the children…”</p>

                            <p>Quite apart from the work on composer’s lives and compositions he copied great rafts of music (no Xeroxing then!), especially by pre-Baroque composers. Much of that material was not available in printed form, and after copying it he had to arrange it in five parts for the viol quintet. His first tour of Italy took the quintet to Turin, Milan, Rome, Naples, Syracuse and Taormina in Sicily, and back via Trieste and Siena. Picture for yourself the amount of work that Willi had to do as the tour guide and only Italian speaker on these trips. He hauled the five musicians and their instruments through Italy on a train, going third class. They were frequently expected to perform as soon as they arrived. It speaks to his extraordinary tact and patience that the members of the quintet did not strike, but faithfully followed him back to Italy in 1932 and 1933. The critiques they received also did their bit to encourage them. Rome’s La Tribuna said: “An ensemble so well adjusted, filled with style and intelligence that the listener is carried away.” Milan’s L’Ambrosiano said: “They disclosed a veritable paradise to the audience,” and Popolo d’Italia said: “Technically as well as spiritually perfect. You cannot escape the perfect enchantment of the quintet, its beauty of tone and the wonderful unity.” Milan’s La Nazione stated: “Wonderful playing, outstanding interpretation. One was removed to a courtly Renaissance world.” These are just a few samples of extremely complimentary reviews. </p>

                            <p>Aside from essays on music, the <em>Unvollendete Symphonie</em> contains many pieces on art, landscape, religious figures and contemporary artists. Perhaps in time I can translate some of these and get them to you. There is an especially wonderful piece on Chartres that I particularly treasure, but others on Mecklenburg, on St. Nicholas, and many more. The piece on Chartres must have been written when Willi was in Paris. In June of 1930 the Schmids went to Paris. Kate left a brief diary of all they did: visits to every sight worth seeing in the space of a week, along with visits to various people. For example, “Friday, June 6: visited German embassy, Dr. Gerth in the Department of Culture. In the afternoon went along the Seine through the Louvre to the Tuileries, Rue de Rivoli, Opéra, Place d’Étoile, Avenue Marechal Foch, Bois de Boulogne, back over the Champs Elysées, Place de la Concorde.” Whew! On Pentecost Sunday they attended mass at Notre Dame with the cardinal saying mass. They continued their lively pace, but on Monday Kate writes: “Got up at 6, Willi wrote theater reviews for Switzerland, I cleaned shoes, washed gloves, mended stockings.” All somewhat unheard-of activities for hotel guests these days. They then went to Chartres, spending the whole day, and were overwhelmed by its beauty. They came back in the evening and “took an evening walk along the Seine.” Nothing seems to wear them out. On Tuesday, June 10, Kate writes: “First day of work for Willi in the library,” so, she goes sightseeing by herself. The visit continues at a very intense pace, with Willi working and Kate seeing Paris. On Saturday, it is time for Kate to depart for home, but first she would stop in Strassburg to visit the cathedral there, which she does on Sunday, June 15. Willi writes her that morning in Munich: “Dearest Mosella, [her nickname based on Moselle wine, her favorite] I thought of you the entire morning…You were so dear yesterday when you left!….I won’t look right or left, just work.”  After he has a note from Kate from Strassburg, he replies: “I was so happy to get it, that’s why I had to send you a telegram... I worked at the library [the <em>Bibliothèque Nationale</em>] — what a shame, only five hours, and there is so much to do. Now I’m working at home again, through all my books. That will add up to nine or ten hours of concentrated work a day…” Willi had to adjust to the restricted hours that libraries in Latin countries kept.  He also states that he longs for the country: “...always the city, nothing but pavement, the stink of buses and the heat. I am working very hard, including three hours in the evenings. There is so much to do here in Paris. There are so many really crucial resources for me.” On Corpus Christi he says: “Today [June 19, 1930] on Corpus Christi I worked at the library <em>six hours.</em> The guard opened it for me, bribed with five francs, at 10 a.m. Before that I went to mass at the Madeleine. <em>Fête Dieu</em> is no holiday here. The heathenish indifference of the Parisians is depressing—it’s just like Berlin.” He goes over his future schedule on July 20 and says: “By then I’ll have enough of all the trips and will hurl myself on my books, music and gamba... With love and longing, despite the work which propels me.” The next day he says: “Dearest Mosel, I’m writing at the post office. The constantly drunk attendant at the library of course did not turn up at 10 a.m. Meantime I will take care of correspondence.”</p>

                            <p>He dwells on Hedwig Tietz’s imminent visit to Munich, and tells Kate to be sure to spoil her mother. “One morning you’ll have to rent an attractive hackney (you can find one in the phone book by looking for wedding carriages, and make a firm price for the forenoon) and at about 11 drive through the <em>Englische Garten</em> as far as the <em>Aumeister</em> [an inn a little ways out in the country], with your mother, Emmi [her sister-in-law] and the children. Have lunch out there and let the children play in the meadow, and then home again. I won’t drink any wine here and that will make up for it. I’m spending <em>no</em> money.”</p>  

                            <p>He complains:“Every day is filled to the brim with work. At the Opera I would have at least a month of work, then I would be in complete control of all my French stuff. Now I’ll have to stop in the middle again—what a pity.  Maybe I can do it in the fall, before or after Milan. Milan will take, the way I see it from here, at least four weeks, with a daily program of eight to ten hours’ work. Yesterday I heard Cortot, great. Monday [I heard] a marvelous organist, [playing] ancient Frenchmen on the Couperin organ.”</p>

                            <p>On Sunday, June 26, Willi went to hear Wanda Landowska play, after several attempts to get in touch with her. “Gâre du Nord in boiling heat, millions of day trippers, a punishment. Landowska played marvelously, her technique superior... Landowska makes an ostentatious tail like a peacock.  Indescribably vain, her pose is well-nigh unbearable for us, but here it is acceptable.  Polite to me, nothing more. So I wasn’t either... I am very hard-working and happy to be thus. Every day is precious...”</p>

                            <p>His last letter from Paris is written on July 1, and he says:</p> 
                            <p class="inset first last">“Dearest Mosel, How loving your letters always are! A thousand thanks. I am glad you are well taken care of in Traunstein. Are the children happy? And Pipsi too? Can he fish [his favorite entertainment]?  Is Mutti [Oma Hedi] pleased? All these questions you can no longer answer—but Monday you can: I’ll be there on the 9:41 from Strassburg. It’s too bad I can’t get to Poitiers now, but I haven’t finished at the National Library (that is, finished not even remotely, not for a long time, but I’d like to uncover a few gamba pieces for Stadelmann [a harpsichordist Willi sometimes worked with] and me…”</p>

                            <p>He had had a letter from a friend of Kate’s, and says of it: “so dear... but I think her resignation is wrong — what does she mean by saying ‘that is why I am a woman?’ First of all she is a human being, and she is a more significant one than her husband. It is hard!” I am really glad to note that Willi thought of women in the right context: human beings first, women second.</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">He continues: “Oh Mosella, I am so looking forward to you and the children.  I can’t even talk about it. We belong together much more, inseparably, than we realize. Out battles and conflicts are the drawback—but they are necessary, and with them we do not pay too much for the good fortunes of living together and begetting such children. Actually we could both try to master our nerves a little—do you want to, Mosella, the way I do? Yes, well, the few days in Traunstein and Salzburg will be lovely. This is the last letter, and then Munich and alone in the apartment and a long sleep and telling you my adventures. Heavenly! A thousand kisses, your Pitsch.”</p>

                            <p>There is also an undated postcard from Paris that shows the Grand Trianon palace and gardens, by the famous Mansart. “To live here for a fortnight, Mozart and Couperin and Bach, Watteau and LaFontaine, the Greek Anacreonites and a good wine—no, it would be too Godlike for us. Mosel, what do you think? Perhaps, no surely, Cannero was still more beautiful. [Cannero on Lago Maggiore is where they had been on vacation in 1926.] So we’ll have to go back, to the same hut. With the children. Yes? Yes!” </p>

                            <p>After a previous trip to Paris Willi had written on April 6, 1930, to a friend: “You can imagine how much I felt at home there. It is, after Rome, one of our spiritual fatherlands, for even if I am Bavarian, <em>animo et corde</em> I love Europe, and there Paris has first place.”</p>

                            <p>Kate was a most important factor in helping Willi accomplish his work. He was well aware of it, and thanked her for it often. Without her participation his achievement would not have been possible. She forwarded his mail, made phone calls, acted as an agent for him.  He kept her busy. On February 11, 1931, he wrote:</p>

                            <p class="inset first">You write so charmingly and sensibly — I am generally neither the one nor the other! So listen:</p>

                            <p class="inset first">1. I cannot write the report until tonight. I’ll have to include excerpts from the press reports. And I’m not at all sure how I’ll do it, because I really hate to do everything for the quintet but then to review it! (The telegram from Trieste was also from me and cost us a bundle of money.)</p>

                            <p class="inset first">2. I wrote to Dussler. I don’t know when I can give him a definite decision, certainly not before September, he’ll have to be patient.</p>

                            <p class="inset first">3. The music for Köhler is inside my bass viol, which I gave to List to take along. I also told him to give it to Köhler, but I’m sure he forgot. Did he return the viol yet? Please remove the music and Köhler can come and get it. Please ask Kätl [the maid] to clean the poor, ill-used case with some petroleum or something.</p>

                            <p class="inset first">4. One very unfavorable circumstance is that at Ricordi’s, though the people there are exceptionally kind, I can only work in the afternoon between 2 and 6. So the material from the afternoon I usually work up in the morning, when I also read through more recent literature at the Convegno. In a few days I will know whether I can come to the Weinberger premiere. Until then I will work as hard as I can.</p> 

                            <p class="inset first">5. Naturally it is freezing at the Bossis [where Willi was staying]. But I can’t get a room I can heat for less than 200 lire, I made precise inquiries. A hotel is even more expensive, and landlords always ask for a whole month’s rent ahead of time. There is nothing suitable in the center of town. From the Bossis I can get to Ricordi in twenty minutes. Also I usually eat with them in the evenings and of course pay far, far less. At noon I go to the Cooperativa, a feeding station where the employees eat for 8 lire: bad, but it fills you up. Other than that I spend nothing, only now and then the theater. And on the trip I spent nothing more than the others. I bought a few books from which I can learn something, and a fountain pen, because the one Inge gave me was trash, and I got spots on myself twice. Of course the pen was expensive (180 lire), but it is the best Waterman made and I can stop worrying about my writing cares for years to come. You can see for yourself how easily the pen writes, better than any I have had before!</p>

                            <p class="inset first">6. I am absolutely determined to go to Berlin now, in March, as soon as the music making is done, and there to begin with the first copies. I can’t do it at home, mainly because the library does not have the needed manuscripts, so I can’t correct possible deficits. I also don’t want to miss the only novelty before April or May <em>(Neues Musikfest).</em></p>

                            <p class="inset first last"><em>Addio,</em> dearest Mosella, you are and always will be mine, won’t you? I kiss you and the children. </p>

                            <p>Kate’s letters to him are equally filled with solicitude and love. In May 1924 she writes from Schwerin, pregnant with me:</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">In the Pinnower Woods the ground was a carpet of anemones…The nightingales sang in all the bushes and I was amazed at how long the days are now.  It barely got dark, and the landscape was as lovely as I have seen it in a long while. If we could live through an experience like that often, it would be so necessary and so beautiful. I still know nothing dearer than to be yours then, completely yours. Darling, there is nothing I want for my birthday than what I received as a secret love, and what I have wished for each birthday, Christmas, with our child and always….my love for you is so sweet and deep and unquestionable.</p>

                            <p>Willi wishes her a happy birthday on the 13th:</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">What I wish for you on this birthday is only that you will always be happy with me, as happy as we both can be if we love each other with our whole hearts. I often think of a time when you will have a child and will raise it to lead a good life. Real life and a real marriage will perhaps only start then—and how quickly it will develop and unfold and how quickly it will fade and vanish, and then we will be left with nothing constant except the faithfully preserved affection, and the unchanging fidelity of feeling.  I will think of nothing else all day but you...</p>

                            <p>Kate answers this letter, which came with a poem for her birthday, by saying: “I am so happy, quite confused by happiness by your song for me…Only twenty-five years old, darling—and yet with so much in her possession, a truly blessed woman!” Willi’s reply on the 19th says: “I am so glad with you as though I would marry you a second time—and then, there is the hope of a baby from the two of us—dearest, sweetest wife, I don’t know why that thought makes me so happy.”</p>

                            <p>On their wedding anniversary in 1926, Kate was in the country with Pipsi and me. She writes: “Greetings, love, and all happiness for our wedding day! Today I removed a silvery-white hair from my head again, and thought of the time when both of us will be gray, and will look back on a long life together. And that joy for time to come is the loveliest we can know. What you give me and are for me, and what you make of me, increases every day, carries me with dear hands and is something eternal in my life.”</p>

                            <p>In 1929 Kate, Thomi and I were on vacation at the Baltic coast. Willi writes: “How dear you are to write so often…What sweet, clever, lively and headstrong children Dusch and Thomi are—not in the least everybody’s goodie-goodies, you can see that right away. It is so wonderful to have children!”</p>

                            <p>In September 1930 Willi writes from Rome: “Dearest, dearest Mosella, it is so indescribably wonderful here that I am longing for you unspeakably—it is madness that you are not here…Dearest little midge, you just fit here like few people…Next year, darling. And I am longing for Dusch and Thomas. They are Roman children, our children.”  In 1931, he writes from Modena, just before a rehearsal of the gamba quintet, </p>

                            <p>Dearest Mosella, this morning’s dear, long letter from you made me so happy… I always feel it most strongly when I am abroad that despite many impediments, which I am sure have their basis in me, you really like me. Sometimes at home I think that you are a little weary of me, with all my many faults which are so hard to combat, that you long to escape from the confines of this life to somewhere else, to someone else. There may be something to that famous ten-year turning point of a marriage. I only know that despite differences there is no one in the world whom I love more than you. You should hear that, right away today, and know it, Mosel.</p>

                            <p>And he adds, “Tomorrow I am hoping for mail from you. But everything will turn out well, darling. I so long for you. If only I could finally show you Rome!”</p>

                            <p>In April of 1931, Willi is in Berlin, and writes a report to Kate of a visit to Lübeck and Schwerin:</p>

                            <p class="inset first last">In Lübeck I was absolutely assaulted by Traudi Stern [a friend]—I became her father confessor and had to dispense love. Exactly the same in Schwerin: everybody, your mother, Michel, Fredi, Emmi, even Elsie spoke with me privately, then all of them together, and the radio playing in between, and little sleep—I was a wreck. You know, it’s as though all my strength, all my psychic strength was transferred to them. So they are all charged up, but I’ll have to recharge myself, and that is not so easy if you are not here. Yes, you are right. We both with the children live so intensely that to be separated is almost an impairment. I love you so much, Mosella. Oh you, you must always feel it anew, and let me select you as my chosen one, bride, beloved, mother of our children, friend and helper — my sweet, dearly loved Mosella. I kiss you a thousand times.</p>

                            <p>Willi was in Berlin to do research on his history of 19th century opera, staying with Mrs. Jablonski, the mother of his friend. He writes: “I was received with such affection and kindness here, it’s as if I were at home...Dear, kind Mrs. Jablonski put photographs of our children around for me…”<span class="citation">55</span> But he is working really hard. “Here in Berlin, aware of the constant, tenacious capacity for work of significant people like Einstein, Moser, Wolf and Curt Sachs, I am seized with a real joy in accomplishing something, a sense of purpose that will prove that I am somebody also. These great people of course have worked for years toward a firm goal, and I could not do that, so everything remained half done, fragmentary. That will have to stop. I will and shall accomplish something, too.”<span class="citation">56</span></p>

                            <p>I believe that in these years Willi had support from Curt and Hedi Haniel, the cousin of Karl Haniel about whom we heard previously. The Haniels were a little older than Kate and Willi, and lived in Munich. It was a close friendship in which the couples shared trips to the mountains or to visit works of art. I think that in the worst economic times the Haniels furnished funds to help Willi do his research. It is a great pity that Willi was not allowed to finish his work. Peter Dörfler admits that Willi remained a fragment, a torso —not as a man, but as a worker. The creative worker could certainly have been expected to produce worthwhile work in future, but it is not so important to us, because this is a human record of a beautiful life. A quote from one of St. Bernard’s letters to Pope Eugene, written in the 12th century, was found on Willi’s desk after his death. It said, “It is entirely ordinary that sometimes something happens that is not ordinary.” Something like that brought an end to Willi’s life, but we continue to be grateful for what he was.</p>

                            <p>On May 24, 1932, Willi wrote to his parents, sending them an interesting little product. I had written a message, supposedly originating with the grandparents, and left it on his desk. It said, including misspellings, <em>“Renate </em>[I used my school name], <em>Thommas, Käte, Wili und die Hedi ale 5 sind liebe Schezchen mein. Oma und Opa”</em> (Renate, Thomi, Kate and Willi and Hedi are all five sweethearts of mine, Oma and Opa). I had written it with a chicken feather that Vati had cut, to show me how they used to make pens.  Willi said, “We are very glad to hear it, and all five sweethearts send their best!”</p>

                            <p>In April 1933 the Schmids’ friends, the Haniels, were in Sicily, and Willi wrote to them: </p>

                            <p class="inset first">Stay in Taormina an extra week, Hedi and Curt…there can’t be anything more wonderful.  I often dream of settling on one of the Greek islands, near Lesbos or on Cyprus, to read the poets, to share fruit and wine, and to honor the Gods whom no one honors any longer, or honors wrongly. Vita activa—vita contemplativa; do we Europeans of 1933 even remember that those are the lodestones of life? Anyone who sets himself to contemplation is seen as a stranger, even an enemy.</p>

                            <p class="inset">You know how to contemplate, to look, to see. You have that art and that scholarship.</p>

                            <p class="inset first"><em>Trinkt, ihr Augen, </em></p>
                            <p class="inset"><em>was die Wimper hält</em></p>
                            <p class="inset last"><em>Von dem goldnen Überfluss der Welt.</em></p>

                            <p class="inset">Drink, ye eyes,</p>
                            <p class="inset">whate’er the brow will hold</p>
                            <p class="inset last">Of the golden plenty of the world.</p>

                            <p>In May 1934, Willi took one more trip to Italy, with Father Thomas. They took their time in Rome to study and look, but Willi’s postcard tells of his favorite part of the trip, Arqua Petrarca, a rural place outside Rome where Petrarca died. In Ravenna, where they visited San Vitale, they spent the afternoon lying in a pine forest five miles from the town.  Here Willi praises the “deep solitude, wild doves, thick underbrush—and this forest was cited by Dante, whose mausoleum we visited, and that made a worthy ending to our day.  You must and will see all of that!” They head home in time to celebrate Kate’s birthday.  This was the last card she receives from him.</p>

                            <p>Here is his last letter, written on June 26, 1934, at 10 p.m.:</p>

                            <p class="inset first">It is profoundly quiet, only intense rain is audible outside the open window. After a day that brought less work than usual, I am peacefully at my desk for once, and am tidying a number of things. Basically I am too tired to write, but on the other hand I have thought of you so often for weeks and months that I cannot help it, I must send you a greeting.</p>

                            <p class="inset">It really is unthinkable that once again we will not see each other this summer. And life flows on, it trickles and rushes away, hour by hour, night by night, season by season. The trees are green again and rustle, the strawberries have been eaten and the pears are beginning to ripen.</p>

                            <p class="inset">And you tell yourself: it will be like that twenty or twenty-five times more, and then you will collapse because there is some sort of crack in the machinery, and then the doctor ascertains a nice Latin ailment, you are driven away in a wooden wagon, your family weeps and mourns, and by the next summer, the 21st or the 26th, a son or a daughter may occasionally arrive by streetcar where in Section such-and–so you call five square feet of stony earth your own, bringing you flowers and paying the mason’s bill.</p>

                            <p class="inset">Well, that’s how it is. There is nothing to be done about it, the law is iron-clad, it is unrelenting. And because it is so inexorable we have become anxious. I am. Don’t say it is cowardly or greedy for life. It is just longing for a few hours of happiness more or less.</p>

                            <p class="inset last">Oh come, come again and we’ll walk in the fields and to the lakes, and we’ll climb the steeples again. Your watchman wakes often and blows his trumpet.  He dreams like all German watchmen.  He looks into the countryside and yet cannot descend from his tower.  He calls and waves…</p>
